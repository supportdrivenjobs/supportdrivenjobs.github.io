      <title>Dave Customer Success Lead &amp; Social Media Marketing</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ever found yourself paying $40 for a cup of coffee (and you’re not insane) then you’re already familiar with the problem we’re trying to solve - overdrafts. Dave.com outsmarts overdrafts by predicting your future expenses and unlocking your upcoming paycheck. Instead of charging interest or predatory fees, Dave lets users decide what is fair to pay in an effort to disrupt the $38bn in overdraft fees banks collected in 2016 alone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s right. 0% interest. All we ask is that you tip us if we helped you. It was a crazy social experiment based on the belief that people are inherently good. We are happy to report that this is the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That said, compassion for others is key to our company culture and hopefully a value you cherish. Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your role is crucial as it informs everything we do - from marketing to product development. You are our eyes and ears on the ground. You&amp;#39;ll not only help with customer support but you&amp;#39;ll also take an active lead in crafting our voice on social media. By talking directly with customers, you&amp;#39;ll develop insight as to exactly who our target audience is and how best to communicate with them to help serve their needs. One hand feeds the other.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are started by a 4X entrepreneur ($85mm exit) and are backed by investors like Mark Cuban, SV Angel, The Chernin Group, David Friedberg, The Kraft Group, SRI, Diplo and more. We have great healthcare, cute office dogs, a patio to get your daily intake of Vitamin D and a basketball hoop to get you from slouching. But more important than all this stuff, we’re sick of people getting ripped off by banks and predatory lenders. We’re not a budgeting app. That’s for rich people. We’re here to help the majority of Americans living between the coasts. But it’s cool, we love LA and hope you do too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior experience in tech support, banking or insurance is a big plus.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent grammar and communication skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social media marketing experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be a good human being.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>MeetEdgar Customer Service Pro</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/meetedgar.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/meetedgar.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re looking for a tech-savvy people person to join our superpowered squad of customer service pros. Our product serves an amazing community of business owners, bloggers, and social media professionals, and you’ll be on the front lines for answering their questions and keeping them happy as heck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our CX team operates on a solution-driven philosophy, and we want to up the ante with even more personalized, one-on-one attention wherever we can. (That means actually solving problems for our users - not just saying what we think they want to hear.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next addition to our team will be someone who is legitimately passionate about providing the best in customer support - someone who can tackle tasks like hopping on an impromptu video call with a customer, or working on personalized onboarding and engagement campaigns alongside the rest of our solution-focused team members.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edgar launched in Summer 2014, and we already have thousands of happy, paying, fabulous customers. We’re also growing by about ~20% month over month, which means lots of users - and lots of support! Fortunately, you’re an empathetic and articulate communicator with an outlook so positive it’s almost creepy. You love people? We love you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Deets Cheat Sheet&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You live anywhere in North America&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full Time - 40 hours a week; 9am - 5pm, 10am - 6pm, or 11am to 7pm Eastern Time (Your first month will be from 10am - 6pm ET)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re super comfortable with social media (like, sweatpants-level comfortable)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;ll be helping our customers out with general questions, techie-type troubleshooting, and a wee bit of salesy stuff. Your knowledge of social media and Internet marketing is icing on top of the support cake.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re motivated, proactive, and quite often referred to as the technically inclined go-to in your personal circle of friends and family&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You want to make lots of people super happy!&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;** Please note that we are accepting applications for this role through June 2, 2017. If we think you are a fit for the role, we&amp;#39;ll be in touch by June 9, 2017.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your greatest talent in life is putting people at ease and making them feel heard. (Or juggling chainsaws, because that’d be SO COOL.) You don’t take it personally when someone has a complaint, so when the going gets salty, you stay sweet and bounce right back to help out whoever’s next in line. We live on the Internet, so you’re a master of written communication and can always tell whether someone needs a quick answer or a little extra hand-holding. You love working with tech, exploring new tools and apps, and using your black belt in Google Fu to find resourceful solutions for the most problem-y problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re into CS that’s smart, proactive, and actually helpful, so don’t expect to spend day after day getting smacked in the face with complaints and sending the same soul-sucking form responses to people. (That’s SO not your style.) You’re a translator who speaks 1000 dialects of Customer-ese, so when somebody has a problem, you know how to suss out the issue at its heart and put their pain point in your crosshairs. You’ve got a mind of your own, and you’re looking for a job that’ll let you use it, and make serious contributions outside of just answering emails. (Even though you’re a total pro at it.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re not just a job-doer - you&amp;#39;re a job-FINISHER. One who takes ownership of the challenges you face, and sees them through to the end!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And you know, you’re a just-plain-swell human being. (It’s okay for you to admit that!) Customer service takes smarts AND a sparkling personality, and yours sparkles like a diamond fresh out of the dishwasher. You love being part of an awesome team, but you’re also good at the whole self-management thing - you’re in charge of a lot of your own workflow, so you’ve gotta be able to focus and prioritize without anyone creepily staring at you over the wall of a cubicle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You should . . .&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have previous SaaS support, help desk, or call center experience. (Extra bonus points if you&amp;#39;ve also worked in the food service industry and came out alive!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be open to new and unique challenges — you&amp;#39;ve got problem-solving skillz to pay the billz (in this case, literally)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Know your @-replies from your @-mentions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Understand what &amp;quot;inspect element&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;view source&amp;quot; are (hint: they aren&amp;#39;t the titles of science fiction movies)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be comfortable video-chatting with current and potential users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have a working knowledge of basic social media marketing strategy and common practices&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Look elsewhere if you . . .&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;can&amp;#39;t take constructive criticism&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;don&amp;#39;t use social media&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;don&amp;#39;t live in North America or can&amp;#39;t work the hours described&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;are on dial-up and can&amp;#39;t get broadband where you live&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Perks and Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam! And yes, everyone actually uses all 4 weeks)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Up to two months family leave for new parents (including adoption!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly cleaning service for your home - not that we don&amp;#39;t have total faith in you&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Paid home Internet service&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coworking space/coffee shop working expenses&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Health, dental, and vision coverage for you and your fam&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401(k) plan with employer match&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An extra paid day off per quarter so you can volunteer in your community (awww)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New Mac laptop (#blessed)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Books, conferences, and other educational resources to help you be even more amazing at what you do!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;TSA pre-check to make getting to retreats and conferences a breeze&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check ‘em out in even more detail here (you know you’re curious)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>The Omni Group Phone Support Human</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/omni.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 4 May 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/omni.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is growing our band of Support Humans (also known as our Tech Support team). Our search is for coworkers who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our macOS and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have surprisingly pleasant conversations about software.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We look for hires with positivity, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t rely on binders of troubleshooting scripts; your imagination will be one of your most important tools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Activities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When customers call with questions about our Mac &amp;amp;amp; iOS apps, you’re their first contact. Know the answer? Great! If not, gather information and we’ll help you find it. (You should enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more here.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it comes to inventing great software, we believe being friendly is at least as important as being smart. If you need help with a problem, you’ll have plenty of people to ask - and they’ll be happy to talk about it. When we disagree, we do it respectfully. No one furthers themselves by tearing you down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Compensation and Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our amazing customers love our apps and push them to their limits. If earning gratitude by helping them brings you happiness, you’ll enjoy this job. We depend on Support Humans when crafting our products; they speak for and represent our customers’ needs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We offer a base salary in the mid-$40k/year range, a 401k with matching, incredible insurance for you and your family, and the potential for profit sharing.

We help bridge the gap between what the customer situation is and how the product is able to help them. It’s the job of the customer support team to help our customers achieve their goals using issuu. It’s support’s job to help issuu to continue to be the best digital publishing platform in the world by ensuring that the customers’ stories are at the forefront of our work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The customer support team feeds into our core objectives by helping to create customer loyalty and community. We ensure that the customer is getting the most out of the product and the publishers are on the right price plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About the Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the leader of the team, you need to be a passionate customer advocate and a great storyteller. Our support team is customer-driven and data-informed, so you need to be equally comfortable with numbers and words.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This job is for a doer. You’re expected to be able to set up processes and select tools, to formulate, document, implement and communicate policies, to establish metrics and build dashboards, to identify opportunities and execute on them. You’ve done it before and you’re excited for the opportunity to build and lead the support for a broad consumer and business base.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You also know that support is a team effort, so training and mentorship are integral to this role. You&amp;#39;ll be expected to get your hands dirty and to lead by example by managing customer inquiries and writing help articles, but you will also be leveling up our support teams as an amplifier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your work will not be limited to your direct team: issuu support works intimately with our marketing, sales, engineering, product, and business intelligence teams on a daily basis. You will serve as a voice and representative of the customer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The office is conveniently located next to the Palo Alto Caltrain station. We provide catered lunches, regular outings and monthly passes for public transit. Our support team is located in Palo Alto and Copenhagen, so you’ll need to be able to travel from time to time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lead the support efforts at issuu. This work consists of:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Handling support tickets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developing support procedures.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Defining and performing processes.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Writing and reviewing help center articles.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conducting status reviews.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working with our org to create new processes to scale support quality.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You should have experience in training support team members, and the ability to connect with all types of learning and working styles.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re a self starter. You&amp;#39;re willing to dive into projects and get things done, but in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t alienate your team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have 3 or more years in a support environment for a technical company with 1 or more years in a management capacity. Or 3 years in a product management role dealing with customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have opinions on the state of customer support in our industry, and you have ideas on how to raise the bar.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Preferred Qualifications&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience scaling teams.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What We Offer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be a part of issuu – an amazing place with room for parents, foodies, geeks, odd birds and the occasional normal person&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Informal, inclusive and very flexible workplace&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive compensation package&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flat hierarchy – every opinion matters regardless of team and position&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
