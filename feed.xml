      <title>Help Scout Customer Champion</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/helpscout.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 1 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/helpscout.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Support is Help Scout&amp;#39;s bread and butter. We’re pleased to be searching for our sixth, full-time support team member. Our ideal hire is motivated by what we&amp;#39;re doing as a company, and eager to contribute on the front lines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About the Role&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a remote position. We’re looking for someone to work Tuesday - Saturday, preferably PST hours.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;ll be a product expert in all areas. You&amp;#39;ll spend most of your days sending timely, human replies to questions via email, but you’ll also create helpful videos, craft documentation, field phone calls, and offer guided tours.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Customer success is a big piece of the pie. You&amp;#39;ll work one-on-one with customers, helping them to get the most out of Help Scout. You might wing unplanned Skype calls and live screen-shares, or schedule meetings to talk about unique use cases.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We don&amp;#39;t hold you to empty policies or procedures. We expect you to always act in the best interest of the customer. You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked. With great power comes great responsibility.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re sticklers about the customer experience. We’re always refining and polishing the product to perfection. As someone on the front line, your understanding of the product and our customers is incredibly valuable. You’ll regularly chat with the product team to make sure we’re getting it right.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are a free spirit who thrives in an environment where you can do great work without a ton of oversight.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have rare people skills that allow you to get out in front of problems, and proactively help customers with potential troubles. You’re a natural people-person. You’re the type of person that goes out of their way to make things right, always.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have good ole’ fashioned work ethic, day in and day out. You have hustle and take initiative and ownership to see things through to completion. If it needs doing, you do it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Being a Happiness Engineer requires:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Patience, grace, and a sense of humor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
