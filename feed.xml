      <title>1Password Herald of Support</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/1password.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey there! It’s Jacob at AgileBits, makers of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://1password.com/company&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1Password&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Let’s get acquainted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At some point in their life, everyone forgets one of their passwords. It’s an inevitable event. When they do, they usually change it to be more memorable, which means it’ll be easier to guess or crack. Our goal with 1Password is to make remembering and managing passwords a thing of the past. We built 1Password to make security accessible and easy, not distant and arduous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s a noble pursuit, remembering passwords for people. With everything the app does, it can always do better. Every day, we speak with hundreds of our customers about their experience with 1Password, and we use that to improve it for everyone. We’re a team of just over 70 right now, and we’re looking to add even more wonderful ‘bits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all of us here at AgileBits, building and supporting 1Password is a dream job. Doing new things is the core of our culture, and we embrace it each day. Everyone in the company does customer support once a week, and we all brainstorm ways to make our customers’ experience better. Once a month, we have an all-hands call for the whole company to rally on the same page. We even go on an annual cruise to ponder the next 12 months of the journey, and to get to know each other in person. 👋&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Herald of Support, you could be the first voice of AgileBits someone has heard, or you could be the bridge between them and the development team. You could find yourself helping with a sign-in issue in the morning and updating our troubleshooting article for it in the afternoon. We are, after all, quite an &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&amp;quot;&amp;gt;agile&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; bunch, and we get excited about &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;doing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you might do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help new and existing users have a great experience using 1Password.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send well-written responses to customers, around 60 a day when you&amp;#39;re up to speed.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Document new features and common questions in our knowledge base.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be the voice of our customers internally: see that the top issues and requests each week are heard by the development team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn how we do support as a remote company, and make it even better with your voice.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try new things: we&amp;#39;re agile, so new tools and ideas float around every few weeks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you have&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Passion to help, love, and understand people, even the tough ones.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A knack for finding the cause of an issue, and the audacity to keep trying if you&amp;#39;re wrong.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you&amp;#39;re saying.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A personality that makes people smile and is delighted when they do.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Humility to ask for help when you aren&amp;#39;t sure about something.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Optimism and positive written tone, even when it&amp;#39;s raining and you forgot your umbrella (free shower!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you might also have&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Personal experience with 1Password.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A peculiar desire to inspect things, particular elements of the web, often built of chrome or found in a safari; occasionally beside a fiery fox within an opera.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building upon the previous point, you may even enjoy a cup of java while writing your script for the next production.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If you&amp;#39;re a match&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounding like a good fit? Let&amp;#39;s start a conversation and see where it goes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mission that gets us out of bed in the morning is simple: help millions of people get the great manager they deserve. People’s relationships with their managers are a major driver of job satisfaction. With good managers, teams and companies thrive. With bad managers, teams and companies implode.

If you’re the type who’s motivated by translating people’s real-world problems into technical solutions that users love — and doing so seems all the more exciting in an ever-evolving startup environment — then you’ll probably like it here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re self-motivated, collaborative, adaptable and excited about building, fixing, and improving a fast-changing startup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) and a Technical Support Engineer has contact with more customers than anyone else in the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While support tickets may take most of your day, you’ll also work on internal and external documentation and have regular touch points with our Product and Customer Success teams to discuss feature requests, usability issues and user scenarios. You’ll bring your passion for customers and their problems to advocate for product improvements and provide insight that will help us make sure we build the right thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Technical Support Engineers develop deep product, systems and customer knowledge. In the long run there are opportunities to apply that to automate processes and create internal tools or to join our Customer Success team which helps our high revenue customers make the most of our product. We have many new features to build and ideas to implement, so there will be plenty of exciting challenges ahead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today the Technical Support team is powered by Help Scout for tickets, Github Issues for bug tracking and Zapier to help automate some of our support processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although, we mostly interact with each other through Basecamp and Slack and value focused work, we’re not afraid to jump on a Screenhero pairing session or a video call to clarify customer scenarios or share tips on how to troubleshoot issues better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;We’re the right match for you if:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You love technical problem solving&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You enjoy helping others with your technical knowledge and take pride in your work.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You see every support ticket as an opportunity to improve the customer experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You take ownership of delivering results and get satisfaction from getting things done.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re passionate about learning new things.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re not afraid to ask questions if you’re confused about how something works.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You understand written communication is not always perfect and assume the best intentions during interactions with customers and your team. Empathy is one of your strongest attributes.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we look for:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At least 2 years customer support experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience working remotely (it’s not your first time holding a full-time or part-time remote job).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;HTML &amp;amp;amp; CSS knowledge (just enough to troubleshoot and fix issues reported by customers).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Understanding of basic programming concepts (API, variables, if-else statements, loops, etc.). If you know some Javascript too even better!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience working with or supporting email marketing/ business communication tools preferred.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Located in the United States/ Canada or willing to work US Eastern or Pacific hours.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Why should you work with Customer.io?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We want to enable you to do your best work, and this is how we aim to do that—&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Salary:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; We are offering salary of $70,000 USD for this position.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Equity:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; You’ll own a piece of the company. It&amp;#39;s not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we&amp;#39;re planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it may be a nice bonus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Big impact:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company, both with our product and our culture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Great tools:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you&amp;#39;d like to get your job done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Health benefits:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental and vision.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Retreats:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; We want everyone in our company to connect in person whenever possible, so we get everyone together once a year. We&amp;#39;ve had retreats in Barcelona, Romania, and Hunter Mountain, NY.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Vacation:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; Rest and recuperation are important. We offer unlimited paid time off with a two week minimum per year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Diversity at Customer.io&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At Customer.io, we’re committed to building a diverse environment, and encourage minority applicants. So far, we have team members in Scotland, Germany, Canada, and all over the US. Our CEO and CTO grew up in Singapore and Arkansas respectively, but met in New York City. Our company culture is always evolving; people from different backgrounds bring valued perspective and thoughtfulness to the work that we do and the culture we foster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Customer.io provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics. In addition to federal law requirements, Customer.io complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities.

Talk to us!&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apply with your resume, and make sure you tell us why you’re interested in the position!

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/aircall.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;ll join the US business team to ensure that the customers we work with have a great experience. You will be the first point of contact and advocate for clients.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What are the responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be the voice of Aircall - you will be on the front lines! This involves flexing your amazing troubleshooting skills via phone calls, emails, and live chat.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Provide swift and thorough solutions for customers. When absolutely unable to do so, escalate to the dev/tech team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take note and relay customer feedback and insights to Aircall&amp;#39;s internal teams such as the tech, marketing and product teams, in order to constantly improve the customer experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintain an expert-level knowledge of our products and internal management systems as well as curiosity and awareness of new initiatives within in the industry.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we are looking for:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have at least 1+ year of experience in Support and are passionate about it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are technical and problem solver. UDP/TCP ports, REST API and packet losses do mean something to you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a “no task is too small” attitude and the endurance to consistently deliver amazing customer experiences without exception.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have superior written and oral communication skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have strong people skills — you are friendly, a good listener, you ask good questions, and you&amp;#39;re energized by personal interaction.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are a team player who works well with a wide range of personalities and is ready to contribute to an awesome team environment.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Brownie points:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a sense of humour and know how to make fun of yourself.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexibility with schedule to meet the needs of the business.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What are the benefits of working here?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All the caffeine you need to keep you going&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medical/Vision/Dental benefits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tax-free commuter benefits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your metrocard reimbursed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gym reimbursement&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shiny new Mac gear!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>
