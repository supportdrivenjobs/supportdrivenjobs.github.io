      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;YOUR IMPACT&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Support is Help Scout’s bread and butter. We’re pleased to be searching for our sixth, full-time support team member. Our ideal hire is motivated by what we’re doing as a company, and eager to contribute on the front lines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;ABOUT THE ROLE&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a full-time, remote position. You’re someone who thrives working remotely without much (if any) oversight.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be a product expert in all areas. You’ll spend most of your days sending timely, human replies to questions via email, but you’ll also craft documentation, troubleshoot potential bugs, and collaborate with the rest of the team to be as helpful as possible to our customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Customer success is a big piece of the pie. You’ll work one-on-one with customers, helping them to get the most out of Help Scout. You might wing unplanned Skype calls and live screen-shares, or schedule meetings to talk about unique use cases.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We don’t hold you to empty policies or procedures. We expect you to always act in the best interest of the customer. You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked. With great power comes great responsibility.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re sticklers about the customer experience. We’re always refining and polishing the product to perfection. As someone on the front line, your understanding of the product and our customers is incredibly valuable. You’ll regularly chat with the product team to make sure we’re getting it right.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help Scout is focused on the idea of “support-driven growth”, where we emphasize being helpful to our prospects and customers as they pursue their goals. We believe that true sustainable growth for Help Scout is a byproduct of putting our customers and their needs, first. The Support team is one strong part of the Growth team, which means you’ll be actively collaborating with the success, sales and product marketing teams in helping our customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re looking for someone who can work hours that overlap with 9a-12p EST. Because we value work-life balance and creating a sustainable position, we prefer if you are geographically located between GMT and CST (so you do not need to zone-shift or work far outside of normal business hours where you live).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;ABOUT YOU&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re passionate about support. Former teammates and managers would call you resilient. You’re in it for the long haul, and you’re not looking for the “next best thing”. This isn’t your first rodeo, nor is it a stepping stone. We’re looking for someone with at least one year of support experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are self-sufficient and love the challenge of solving problems and learning new things. You welcome an environment where you can do great work independently.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re patient and hardy, with an excellent sense of humor. You’re an exceptional listener and educator, and you’re naturally curious with a strong desire to learn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re an incredible communicator, fluent in written English. You’re just as comfortable on the phone or in person as you are in an email. Your writing is clear and simple, with a proper dose of empathy.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have rare people skills that allow you to get out in front of problems, and proactively help customers with potential troubles. You’re an empathetic problem solver who goes out of their way to help people always.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a good ole’ fashioned work ethic, day in and day out. You have grit and take initiative and ownership to see things through to completion. If it needs doing, you do it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You aren’t scared of a challenge. When you don’t know something, you embrace the chance to grow and get better.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;ABOUT US&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help Scout is a remote team with employees in eleven countries (eight people in the Boston office). We optimize for excellence over geography and overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, chat and video conferencing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re a customer-driven company and always will be. Everything follows the customer experience, no exceptions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Our company is growing and has aspirations of helping millions of people around the world. Accomplishing our goals will present countless challenges and require you to excel in every aspect of the position. It’s hard work, but the people we’re looking for love exploring and solving hard problems.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is not the typical startup “rocket ship.” We’ll never compromise customers or the experience in favor of growth. Our purpose is to build a profitable company that small businesses love and sustain it. We optimize your career at Help Scout for the long term as well, so keeping a healthy work/life balance is an important priority.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We value diversity at Help Scout and welcome all applicants regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression, economic status, ability, disability, religious beliefs or disbeliefs, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, marital status, parental status, or caregiver status.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;International Benefit Stipend - If you’re based outside the US, you’ll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible vacation - Take time off when you need it, we trust you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Paid parental leave, including adoption - 12 weeks if you have or adopt a baby, 4 weeks if your partner has a baby.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Expensify Success Coach</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/expensify-london.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/expensify-london.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you’ll support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. You’re on the front lines to interact with our customers via email and chat predominantly, but we also sprinkle in phone calls and the occasional in-person visit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging work environment. You thrive as an individual contributor and you know how to get shit done. Still wondering whether this is the right role for you? The most successful candidates can:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things change all the time, especially with the product.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company everyday, even if that value is created in a repetitive and not so glamorous way. #oneteamonedream&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about a bug or product flow that’s confusing for our customers, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We&amp;#39;re excited to hear from you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How to improve our reactive support strategy by utilizing data and creativity&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Team projects beyond the inbox, which are designed to positively impact the customer experience and help Wistians grow&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Upon coming on board, you can expect to:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;First three months:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gain an understanding of Wistia’s business, goals, and strategic objectives.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn not only the fundamentals of Wistia’s products and the range of our customers’ goals and use cases, but also how those things manifest themselves in support.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Three to twelve months:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Identify and manage initiatives to achieve consistent excellence in key metrics, including reducing customer contact rate, and increasing customer satisfaction scores and support-specific NPS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ensure our support approach represents our values and mission to make business more human, and constantly elevate the level of customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Explore new avenues for customer support (today, we primarily focus on email)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work closely with the product, engineering, marketing and sales teams to translate customer feedback into strategic initiatives&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Develop Customer Champs, set clear expectations and success benchmarks for growth, and curate the resources and support to help them learn, improve, and succeed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Your success will be measured by:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The metrical proxies of Customer Happiness: customer satisfaction ratings from support interactions, and support-specific NPS.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Making the best support be no support, aka lowering contact rate (the percentage of our customers who need reactive support in any period).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The consistent delivery, by the whole Customer Happiness team, of an effective and efficient support experience that represents Wistia’s values and mission.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Leading a team that continually learns and develops, with each Champ moving towards mastery in technical support or customer education, or developing skills to support priority initiatives within Wistia&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regular improvement in the Customer Happiness team’s internal employee NPS.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this sounds exciting to you, we hope you&amp;#39;ll get in touch! We&amp;#39;re profitable, growing, and have raised only seed money, so we have the luxury of being able to invest in whatever will best serve the long-term value of the company. We know the biggest investment we can make is in our employees, so we provide:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
