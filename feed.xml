      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/vimeo.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Vimeo is a leading online video platform with more than 160 million visitors per month. We provide an expansive, high-end toolset for video creators, creative professionals, and businesses, as well as a world class video player.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our advanced platform and passionate members are matched by an equally remarkable Support + Community team who provide expert assistance on topics like video playback, compression, uploading, and embedding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;#39;s where you come in. We&amp;#39;re looking for a Technical Support Manager to join our Support + Community team at our gorgeous NYC HQ. You&amp;#39;ll take the lead on supporting users through their playback, player customization, uploading, and video / audio compression issues in all the different places they can occur (e.g., vimeo.com, other websites, mobile devices, and connected TVs).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;RESPONSIBILITIES:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tackle support escalations from other team members, providing friendly, expert assistance to users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vet and ticket user-reported bugs, and communicate with our Engineering team, users, and community team about the status of each open issue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create user-facing FAQs and troubleshooting instructions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create training documents and troubleshooting guides to empower other team members to effectively handle issues on their own&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Provide Support team with regular updates about all outstanding issues impacting users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Track trends in technical issues and user feedback and prepare monthly and annual reports of the most noteworthy items&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proactively surface major user concerns to our Product team&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintain our &amp;quot;Compression Guidelines&amp;quot; and tutorials - the technical guidelines we provide to Vimeo uploaders&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;SKILLS &amp;amp;amp; KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Expert technical troubleshooting skills or some kind of technical background&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Curiosity for understanding how things work “under the hood”&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with how websites are put together, and an aptitude for keeping up with constantly evolving technologies&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1+ year of experience in customer support (the more the better)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent written communication and interpersonal skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with all major browsers and developer tools&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with the processes of video editing and compression (let us know which programs you&amp;#39;ve used!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proactive and highly organized approach to work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with the Vimeo platform and player&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you know what these terms mean already, you&amp;#39;ve got a leg up: Content Delivery Network, H.264, adaptive streaming, bits vs. bytes, JavaScript console.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;BONUS POINTS:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(These aren&amp;#39;t requirements, but they&amp;#39;d be giant gold stars on your resume)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have experience working with both engineers and end-users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have experience using a bug tracking system and ticketing technical issues (GitHub, Jira, etc.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;ABOUT THE COMMUNITY TEAM:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Vimeo’s Community team is responsible for making sure that the amazing humans who use our website are happy, supported, and engaged. Community team members maintain our Help Center, manage the Community Forums, host Weekend Challenge video contests, and provide expert product and technical support via email and social media. They’re also advocates for the community within the company. They spend all day interacting with Vimeans directly, so they’re the experts on what our members love about Vimeo and what features they’d like to see in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/klaviyo.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Email will no longer suck. Klaviyo is using technology to reinvent email marketing from the ground up! For far too long email marketing has been pretty selfish. Companies blast everyone with the same email, not because they think that’s what customers want, but because they don’t have a choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Klaviyo fundamentally changes the game. Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it to drive a platform that’s part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that drives results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn’t really changed. We’re here to fix that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Success at Klaviyo&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Success is a super critical function that sits at the intersection of product, sales and marketing. The Success team is at the core of our business! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You Will&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond to customer inquiries&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate technical concepts effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Serve as the Klaviyo Product Expert&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to the knowledge base of the Klaviyo Customer Success Team&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with Engineering, Sales and Product to improve customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You Have&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;3+ years in a technical support role&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In depth working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/fastly.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fastly is a flexible, transparent content delivery network that accelerates and scales websites, mobile applications, and APIs. We do this by moving content physically closer to a company’s end users. If you’re tweeting, pinning, shopping on Wayfair or ModCloth, reading the news on Fast Company or The Guardian, browsing pictures on Imgur, or coding with GitHub, Fastly is improving your user experience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The global CDN market is estimated to grow from $3.71 billion in 2014 to $12.16 billion in 2019. With an exciting product roadmap and a fast-growing international team, Fastly is redefining what’s possible online.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re building a better Internet.

It&amp;#39;s a core value, and something that shapes our culture.

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Assist with customer CDN configurations over email and chat&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate customer needs and requirements with the engineering, product and sales teams&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to our customer facing documentation when necessary&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to the processes and policies that scale our support organization as we grow&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong verbal and written communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with a *nix environment
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with one or more programming languages&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to debug connections using cURL, traceroute, telnet and other network diagnostic tools&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>ProTrainings Customer Happiness Hero</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/protrainings.html</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/protrainings.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You...&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Are good at seeing things from other people’s point of view&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strive to take care of others like you would take care of your own family&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Love to build relationships with customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Want to take customer care to the next level&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Emulate other companies that provide amazing service: Disney, Chick-Fil-A, Nordstrom, Ritz-Carlton, Trader Joe’s, and Zappos are some great examples&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See the value in having a rabid, loyal customer base&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Embrace change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Push for excellence&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Who we are&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve been certifying people in CPR, first aid, and bloodborne pathogens since 2003. Not only that -- we’ve been increasing in size, training more people, adding more trainings, and getting bigger and stronger every year since.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are a collaborative, growing team that creates and supports the world’s best training. Our online health and safety courses help save lives every day (literally -- we have heard countless stories from our customers who have saved the lives of loved ones after using our training).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We work out of an awesome, open building in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we believe&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Providing life-saving training is a noble pursuit that is worth getting up every morning to create.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that every team member is crucial and makes a difference, which is why we hire highly-motivated, hard-working, well-rounded people who pursue excellence in everything they do. That’s also why we’re very selective and particular about hiring great people, especially in this position, as you will be the face of our company to many of our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We think that surprising and delighting our customers at every turn makes life-long, loyal supporters who rave about you to their friends; not to mention, it helps make the world a better place to live!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that training should be FREE, because nobody should have to take out their wallet to learn how to save a life. In fact, we believe this so strongly, we created a StudentCPR program that trains thousands of high school students every single year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that you can work really hard and still have a ton of fun. You can play ping pong to blow off steam, chat with customers from our ceiling suspended hammock chair, and play games with co-workers at the office at night. Work and fun are not mutually exclusive -- having a good work-life balance is critical to loving your job and doing great work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We love innovation. We don’t like to do things like everyone else. A great example is our Single Use Manikin Option (SUMO). For the first time in the history of CPR training, people are able to complete their entire certification without leaving home.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What you’ll be doing&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Delighting our customers by forming real relationships with them (through phone, email, and chat), including sending out postcards and follow-up emails to show our appreciation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/code-climate.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 6 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/code-climate.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Code Climate is the world&amp;#39;s largest static analysis platform, helping over 50,000 developers improve the health of their codebases. We work hard to provide clear, timely and actionable insights derived from source code. We recently launched the Code Climate Platform, the first open, extensible platform for all types of static analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Code Climate is available on our hosted platform for free for open source projects, and offers paid subscriptions to analyze private source code either on our hosted platform or Code Climate Enterprise, our behind the firewall product. Our customers include Fortune 500s, public and private companies, large and small, with a range of technical sophistication and exposure to static analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Customer Success Manager you’ll work with customers to help them achieve their software goals, primarily (but not necessarily exclusively) using Code Climate. You’ll also work closely with our engineering and customer service teams as a voice for these customers within the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a key part of the external face of Code Climate, we&amp;#39;re looking for someone who is invested in the success of our customers, and represents our values well by putting customers first and executing rigorously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Examples of problems you&amp;#39;ll be solving:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Becoming an active and positive collaborator in the customer’s mission to better improve their code and software development processes by learning about their unique goals, successes and challenges.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Navigating organizations to determine who are the influencers and decision makers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Training clients and promoting wider and deeper Code Climate adoption within their organizations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Educating customers with unique software development processes and environments about the best way to use Code Climate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Concierge onboarding for customers with large teams of developers to ensure smooth integration of Code Climate into their organization&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Integrating Code Climate into an organization’s existing IT environment -- including source code management, code review tools, and collaboration tools like Trello and Slack.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Diagnosing issues affecting customers and collaborating with the product engineering team to identify solutions (and creatively suggesting workarounds, when necessary).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re awesome because:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You elicit glowing testimonials from customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You communicate clearly, concisely and honestly. Customers trust you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You empathize with issues customers face and are compelled to solve them.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You continually advocate internally on behalf of customers, and can name from memory the problems that our biggest customers face.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re never afraid to strike up a conversation with someone new, online or in person.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re comfortable having discussions with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re able to navigate complex organizations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re technologically curious and always learning.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Working at Code Climate&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Join a small team of around fifteen full-time people who love what they do.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive compensation and meaningful stock options.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible and generous paid time off including an open vacation policy and maternity/paternity leave.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Health, dental and vision insurance. We pay 100% of the premium and 50% of the premium for dependents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Company retreats twice a year. So far we&amp;#39;ve gone to Bali and San Diego.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opportunities to continue your professional development, including attending tech conferences.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dog-friendly office stocked with snacks, drinks and cold-brew iced coffee.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expensify prides itself on solving real-world problems with a team of top-notch product experts. We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you will be focused on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify to solve the problems they face. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. You’ll also gather feedback on how we can evolve Expensify to meet our customer’s needs in the future, and apply your product knowledge to map out these improvements for engineering. When product changes happen, you’ll lead the charge via documentation, blog posts, emails, calls and in-person visits with our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you will be working in our fast-paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most-discussed perk is our offshore, where we spend a month abroad working as a team from a remote location. Last year we went to Cambodia and Thailand. Where do you want to go next?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’re an entrepreneur who enjoys thinking through challenging problems, working across functional groups and articulating yourself in both technical and non-technical settings. You’re poised and confident when talking to customers and can always find the time to work with your colleagues to get any issue resolved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Has excellent communication skills. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, the next moment need to communicate how we are going to sell this feature with a member of the sales team, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in all scenarios.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is passionate about building, maintaining and making our software better. It’s what we do as a company.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Can manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is comfortable learning from peers in an informal fashion. After all, we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who&amp;#39;s able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is well-versed in saying “no”. We often have to say no to ensure that our product stays simple and user-friendly. Saying no and having a compelling argument as to why requires in-depth product knowledge and knowledge of the problem that the customer is trying to solve and is critical to success in this role.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Describe a scenario where you interacted with an irate person. How were you able to turn them around (assuming you were able to)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were given free reign to choose the optimal set of customer support tools, what would they be and how would they optimize your customer success approach?
