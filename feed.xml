      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/resinio.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resin.io provides a software platform that helps developers build, deploy and manage code on connected devices. In short, we make IoT work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our technology is open, standards-based and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;ABOUT THIS ROLE&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As our user base grows and our platform gets more sophisticated, we’re creating a role for a technical content lead to explain what resin.io is and how to use it successfully. You’ll champion our efforts to create understanding about resin.io and lead the charge on technical documentation. You’ll work closely with our design, development, product and support teams to understand and communicate about the platform to our users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;RESPONSIBILITIES&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage our docs from end to end. Document new features, maintain existing docs, organize the structure and flow of our docs, and ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency across all of our technical documentation, including GitHub repos.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write content such as blog posts, forum posts, white papers, and website copy to explain our product features, design principles, and architecture to users.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create tutorials, projects, examples, and screen capture videos to demonstrate our platform.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help design the user onboarding experience and ongoing user education programs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work closely with the product and development teams to understand technical details and their implications for users.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Measure our success in helping users understand resin.io, share progress with the team, and find ways to improve.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to dive deep while keeping the big picture in mind. You can create lots of great content while seeing how it fits into our overall story and broader goals.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to work with developers to gather technical details. Like a journalist, you ask questions to get to what’s most important for users to know.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Organized, thorough and pay close to attention to detail. You’re the person who will submit a pull request to fix a typo.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Self-motivated and able to set direction and priorities. You can be incredibly productive without much oversight and know where your time is best spent.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Skilled at learning and teaching new concepts. You don’t need to be a developer, but you do need to speak the language of software, build a basic understanding of resin.io products, and be able to teach others about our technologies.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to understand the product from a user’s perspective and explain features in a way that users will appreciate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fluent in written and spoken English.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with resin.io-related technologies (e.g. Docker, Linux, IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Interest in trying your hand at hardware projects.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience writing technical docs, blog posts, briefs, and white papers - writing samples welcome!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience in user-facing roles (e.g. quality assurance, support, development, product, experience design).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;BENEFITS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You aren&amp;#39;t intimidated by numbers and understand the value of using data to make intelligent decisions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What you&amp;#39;ll do&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be the first point of contact for customer questions through phone, email, live chat, and social media (even on the weekends!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Use metrics and consumer insight to help make SeatGeek better.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consistently go above and beyond for our customers (think generous refunds and unexpected gifts, just because!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are a people person and are known to carry on a conversation with anyone.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are passionate about technology and user experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/kayako.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kayako is seeking a Customer Advocate to join our Customer Support team. We have offices in Gurgaon and London, but you’re welcome to work from anywhere with an internet connection!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kayako is one of the leading customer service platforms, used by more than 30,000 organizations to deliver a better customer experience to millions of customers. We believe that customer support is more than just answering questions - we directly impact business goals through providing feedback to our product team and driving customer success. Our support team is one of the main reasons for our success and we want to be role models for our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe traditional help desk software prevents great customer experiences by depersonalizing customers and disempowering teams. That’s why we built Kayako, the unified customer service platform, to help teams work better together to deliver better, personalized and memorable experiences to their customers at scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the flag-bearer of the next level of customer experience in the industry, we are looking for someone who is not deterred by the road blocks and instead enjoys the challenge and keeps moving forward. Someone who doesn’t believe in following the herd. Someone who is proactive and enthusiastic, passionate, super friendly, well-spoken and energetic. A good sense of humor is also always a plus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;ll love this role if you get your kicks by helping others. We’re looking for someone who loves solving problems and creating long term customer relationships. This is a great opportunity if you care deeply, genuinely and passionately about customer support and about the role it plays in making a customer-centric team successful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities and goals you’ll own:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond to and resolve customer queries through chat, email and the community forum quickly and effectively.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Educate and empower our customers to get better at customer support through Kayako&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Become an expert on Kayako features and capabilities&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Drive our Voice of the Customer program to advocate for the customer and improve Kayako through incorporating user feedback&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Escalate critical support issues to the appropriate internal channel&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help to develop the customer support profession through sharing knowledge, contributing to blog posts, experimenting with new innovations and discussing best practices.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Assist in creating first-class Help Center documentation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Increase customer satisfaction and build loyalty through providing amazing, personal customer support.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Who will love this job:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You like making things easier for customers and colleagues. If there’s a roadblock, you want to smooth it away.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are energised by interacting with and helping people. You know that everyone has trouble sometimes, and seek to empower and educate our customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You love reading and learning about new ways of doing things. There’s always a better way.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re a positive person and know how to look on the bright side.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You bring solutions to the table not just problems. (But you aren’t afraid to point out where we’re going wrong).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re comfortable with a little chaos and uncertainty. We move fast and sometimes decisions are made without all of the information.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Experience and requirements:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent verbal and written communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to solve problems logically and critically&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;1+ years in online customer support, preferable supporting a SaaS product&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Demonstrate effective time management and organizational skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A strong understanding and working knowledge of the internet and technical concepts (eg. you understand the terms HTML, browser and cache)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Reasons why you’ll love working at Kayako:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock options - we want everyone to be invested in the success of their work.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited PTO - take time off as you need it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pension - we’ll contribute to your pension so you can plan for the future.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Private health insurance package - including a 50% discount gym membership, because we want to be and stay healthy.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Choose your own gear - we want you to have all the tools you need to do the work best.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible working hours - we love spending time in the office together and think we’re at our best in-person, but we’re realistic and flexible about it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Family friendly - we operate a childcare vouchers scheme for all our employees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly on-site massage - yes, we have someone come in once a month. No, it’s not weird.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fully stocked fridge and pantry - keeping you going. Standard.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly craft beers and wines - every Friday. No reason or explanation needed. And we won’t judge you if you wanted to start on Thursday, either.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly fruit delivery - to compensate for the weekly beers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly team lunches - because we like food, and we love bonding over it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regular learning opportunities - from Lunch n’ Learns to opportunities to attend the best industry events, we want you to grow in every way possible.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(*please note some of these apply to UK office based staff only)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Equal opportunities (it is boilerplate, but we believe it)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Kayako is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability or age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Kayako&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;ve brought customer service a long way.

      <title>1Password Herald of Support</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/1password.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 7 Feb 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/1password.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey there! It’s Jacob at AgileBits, makers of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://1password.com/company&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1Password&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Let’s get acquainted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At some point in their life, everyone forgets one of their passwords. It’s an inevitable event. When they do, they usually change it to be more memorable, which means it’ll be easier to guess or crack. Our goal with 1Password is to make remembering and managing passwords a thing of the past. We built 1Password to make security accessible and easy, not distant and arduous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s a noble pursuit, remembering passwords for people. With everything the app does, it can always do better. Every day, we speak with hundreds of our customers about their experience with 1Password, and we use that to improve it for everyone. We’re a team of just over 70 right now, and we’re looking to add even more wonderful ‘bits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all of us here at AgileBits, building and supporting 1Password is a dream job. Doing new things is the core of our culture, and we embrace it each day. Everyone in the company does customer support once a week, and we all brainstorm ways to make our customers’ experience better. Once a month, we have an all-hands call for the whole company to rally on the same page. We even go on an annual cruise to ponder the next 12 months of the journey, and to get to know each other in person. 👋&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Herald of Support, you could be the first voice of AgileBits someone has heard, or you could be the bridge between them and the development team. You could find yourself helping with a sign-in issue in the morning and updating our troubleshooting article for it in the afternoon. We are, after all, quite an &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&amp;quot;&amp;gt;agile&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; bunch, and we get excited about &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;doing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you might do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help new and existing users have a great experience using 1Password.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send well-written responses to customers, around 60 a day when you&amp;#39;re up to speed.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Document new features and common questions in our knowledge base.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be the voice of our customers internally: see that the top issues and requests each week are heard by the development team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn how we do support as a remote company, and make it even better with your voice.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try new things: we&amp;#39;re agile, so new tools and ideas float around every few weeks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you have&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Passion to help, love, and understand people, even the tough ones.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A knack for finding the cause of an issue, and the audacity to keep trying if you&amp;#39;re wrong.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you&amp;#39;re saying.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A personality that makes people smile and is delighted when they do.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Humility to ask for help when you aren&amp;#39;t sure about something.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Optimism and positive written tone, even when it&amp;#39;s raining and you forgot your umbrella (free shower!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What you might also have&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Personal experience with 1Password.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A peculiar desire to inspect things, particular elements of the web, often built of chrome or found in a safari; occasionally beside a fiery fox within an opera.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building upon the previous point, you may even enjoy a cup of java while writing your script for the next production.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If you&amp;#39;re a match&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounding like a good fit? Let&amp;#39;s start a conversation and see where it goes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Jhana Support/Ops Engineer</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/jhana.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/jhana.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mission that gets us out of bed in the morning is simple: help millions of people get the great manager they deserve. People’s relationships with their managers are a major driver of job satisfaction. With good managers, teams and companies thrive. With bad managers, teams and companies implode. That’s why we built a web application to help managers be effective people leaders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re a high-performing team of entrepreneurs and deep thinkers who get really excited about ideas and learning. And with more than 50 delighted customers (including FitBit, Etsy, Carfax, and Glassdoor), we’re well on our way to building a strong, sustainable enterprise SaaS company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About the job:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll be our first in-house engineering hire — a huge opportunity to lead the company in scaling our technical onboarding and support processes. You’ll also be collaborating with our platform development agency and product and client success teams to develop a secure, seamless, and downright awesome experience for managers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This often means collaborating and coordinating with multiple stakeholders, from a client’s IT department to our own non-technical writers. If you’re the type who’s motivated by translating people’s real-world problems into technical solutions that users love — and doing so seems all the more exciting in an ever-evolving startup environment — then you’ll probably like it here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage technical onboarding and support for new Jhana customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Happiness Engineer, helping people is your passion. Maybe you’ve developed your own support philosophy by reading books like Delivering Happiness or Exceptional Service, Exceptional Profit. Perhaps you’re a contributor in an online support community such as the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transforming publishing on the web is no small task. Our goal is to build relationships based on trust which result in happy, passionate, loyal customers and colleagues. We do this through listening to their needs and guiding them to the fullest use of the products we offer. We are looking for people with the right mix of compassion, writing skills, and technical knowledge to get the job done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;In general, a typical day involves:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping people use Automattic’s products, including &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Gravatar, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Troubleshooting, investigating, and creating detailed bug reports&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Crafting and editing helpful support documentation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Being an active member of a team that provides around the clock support to our users via live chat, forums, and email&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building a community of support by sharing knowledge and insight amongst team members&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Being a Happiness Engineer requires:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Patience, grace, and a sense of humor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent writing and communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working knowledge of WordPress, HTML, and CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A knack for taking technical language and making it understandable&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A passion for solving tough problems and proposing elegant solutions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happiness Engineers must be fluent and eloquent in written English. If you know additional languages, be sure to tell us!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums are fantastic places to gain the experience required for this position.

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/aircall.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;ll join the US business team to ensure that the customers we work with have a great experience. You will be the first point of contact and advocate for clients.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What are the responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be the voice of Aircall - you will be on the front lines! This involves flexing your amazing troubleshooting skills via phone calls, emails, and live chat.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Provide swift and thorough solutions for customers. When absolutely unable to do so, escalate to the dev/tech team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Take note and relay customer feedback and insights to Aircall&amp;#39;s internal teams such as the tech, marketing and product teams, in order to constantly improve the customer experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintain an expert-level knowledge of our products and internal management systems as well as curiosity and awareness of new initiatives within in the industry.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we are looking for:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have at least 1+ year of experience in Support and are passionate about it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are technical and problem solver. UDP/TCP ports, REST API and packet losses do mean something to you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a “no task is too small” attitude and the endurance to consistently deliver amazing customer experiences without exception.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have superior written and oral communication skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have strong people skills — you are friendly, a good listener, you ask good questions, and you&amp;#39;re energized by personal interaction.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are a team player who works well with a wide range of personalities and is ready to contribute to an awesome team environment.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Brownie points:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a sense of humour and know how to make fun of yourself.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexibility with schedule to meet the needs of the business.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What are the benefits of working here?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All the caffeine you need to keep you going&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medical/Vision/Dental benefits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tax-free commuter benefits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your metrocard reimbursed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gym reimbursement&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shiny new Mac gear!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
