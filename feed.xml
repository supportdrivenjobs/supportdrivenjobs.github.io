      <title>MeetEdgar User Outreach Specialist (Remote | USA)</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/meetedgar.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/meetedgar.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full-time remote position, 40 hours/week&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Like a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence, our marketing team is dedicated to helping people discover something new and exciting - and in our case, that means leading them to Edgar. But what about all those people out there who could use a little extra push? Well, That’s where you come in, dear reader - we’re looking for a User Outreach Specialist who can lead the charge on identifying and nurturing leads, leading product demos, and whatever else our pre-customers might need!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’re a take-charge sort of guy/gal/non-binary individual - somebody who can tell when a person needs a nudge or three in the right direction, and proactively gives them the information they need to make their own brilliant decisions. You’re not a salesperson - you’re a matchmaker, setting people up with bliss-inducing solutions to their most problem-y problems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In this position, that means working with our marketing team to do things like:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Identify and nurture leads via email, social media, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conduct personalized one-on-one demos as needed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond to emails and online chats from our leads&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transition new customers into our onboarding process&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes, the people who’ll benefit most from your help and expertise will come to you - other times, you’ll seek them out yourself. That means you’re someone who understands the weird lil’ intersection of social media, SaaS products, and content marketing where Edgar lives, and the issues that are important to anyone else in that neighborhood. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can you tell when what we offer is what someone’s looking for? How do you communicate that - and how does your strategy change from person to person? What matters most to one type of lead versus another, and how do you help them meet their needs? These are the types of questions you’ll be answering in this position - so be ready! (Sorry, we totally didn’t give you a spoiler alert beforehand.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because this role requires significant interaction with potential customers, you’ll work alongside both our Marketing and Customer Experience teams to make our relationships with our leads better than ever. From conducting proactive outreach to responding to the needs of prospective users, your day-to-day will be the types of one-on-one interactions that a people person’s dreams are made of!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Deets Cheat Sheet&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a full-time, salaried remote position - you must live somewhere in North America and be able to show eligibility to work in the USA&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sales/marketing experience a plus&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Customer service experience also preferred, ideally with technology-related products/services&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An extrovert’s love of reaching out to new people (an introvert’s love of staying at home is okay, though)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to read a situation and determine someone’s needs - even if they don’t spell them out for you&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Confident hosting live demos, Q&amp;amp;amp;A sessions, and sing-a-longs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Demonstrably good judgment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Us&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re a small team of 18-ish people, all working remotely across the US &amp;amp;amp; Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual retreat week where we work together on cool projects all day and rock the karaoke mic all night. (Spoiler alert: This means you have to be willing and able to travel to those retreats! The karaoke, however, is optional.)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;ll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can find out more at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://meetedgar.com/careers/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://meetedgar.com/careers/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and by watching this video (please watch it, it was mad expensive):&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;320&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvU3P43b0rQ&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Perks &amp;amp;amp; Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam! And yes, everyone actually uses all 4 weeks)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly cleaning service for your home - not that we don&amp;#39;t have total faith in you&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Paid home Internet service&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coworking space/coffee shop working expenses&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coverage for health, dental, and vision for you and your fam&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401(k) with matching&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An extra paid day off per quarter so you can volunteer in your community (awww)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New Mac laptop (#blessed)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Books, conferences, and other educational resources to help you be even more amazing at what you do!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Zapier Customer Champion APAC</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/zapier-apac.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/zapier-apac.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;column two-thirds content secondary-blog-entry-jobs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
         
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Normally we hire candidates for our customer champion team from anywhere in the world. However right now we are in need of someone who can help our customers from 12am UTC to 9am UTC. This roughly corresponds with people who live in Australia and Asia. If you&amp;#39;re excited about this role but your main working hours aren&amp;#39;t in this timezone check out our &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/customer-champion-zapier/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;general customer champion application&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;re looking for someone who loves helping people. If you love interacting with people on a daily basis to help them learn how to optimize their work then read on…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know applying for and taking on a new a job at any company requires a leap of faith. We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier. To help share a bit more about life at Zapier here are a few resources in addition to the job description that can give you an inside look at what life is like at Zapier. Hopefully you&amp;#39;ll take the leap of faith and apply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/our-commitment-to-applicants/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Our Commitment to Applicants&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-remote-working/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zapier Guide to Remote Work&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zapier Code of Conduct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/working-on-diversity-and-inclusivity/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Working on Diversity and Inclusivity&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re empathetic to users and can easily put yourself in their shoes. You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered after interacting with support and not stupid because of a small mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You obsess over the details. Maybe you have a one emoticon and one exclamation point rule of thumb for every email. Maybe it&amp;#39;s only two sentences per paragraph. Either way, you make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes the customer delighted to work with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love solving problems. Every customer is different, many times radically so. You relish being able to meet their specific need, and also solving their problems that may have gone unsaid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to write. Almost everything at Zapier is done via written communication (both with customers and between teammates).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re persistent. Support at Zapier is much different than at many software companies. It&amp;#39;s not the same questions over and over again, and often involves researching technical nuances of the apps we support. You love the opportunity to solve new problems every day and won&amp;#39;t give up when you don&amp;#39;t know the answer right away.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to set your own course. At Zapier, we have quick team meetings each week and one-on-one meetings every month and then we go make things happen. You get to make things happen without someone saying so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Things You Might Do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zapier is a startup, so you&amp;#39;ll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you&amp;#39;ll get to lead:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write documentation to help users help themselves (all the documentation on our help site is written and maintained by the support team: https://zapier.com/help/)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work with the product team to build tools that will speed up and increase the quality of support at the same time&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About Zapier&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the past five years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us why you&amp;#39;d be a good fit for this role.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us why you want to work at Zapier instead of somewhere else.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What should our goal be when replying to users?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A user requests an integration with a service that we don&amp;#39;t support yet. Compose a reply to this user.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set up a zap that takes new Gmail emails from a specific sender and adds them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.  Send us the link to the zap and a share link for the spreadsheet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send us a link to an app&amp;#39;s API docs that you think are well done, and explain why you think they are good.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Look at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gist.github.com/WadeFoster/0bd294efe54f8fb8a1e7&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this list&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and pick the 5 things that most excite you. Also pick the 5 things that least excite you. Don&amp;#39;t pick by your opinion of importance, this is mostly to see interest/experience. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about Zapier?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Optional: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.wufoo.com/forms/zv5nyxr0ho7nxi/def/Field208=Customer+Happiness&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Share anonymously some demographic information about yourself&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to help us better track trends related to the backgrounds of candidates interested in working at Zapier in order for us to build a team that represents the users at Zapier and the broader world population.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, wait for us to reply. We reply to everyone, even if we don&amp;#39;t seem like a good fit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Zapier is an equal opportunity employer. We&amp;#39;re excited to work with talented and empathetic people no matter their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, physical or mental disability, or age.
