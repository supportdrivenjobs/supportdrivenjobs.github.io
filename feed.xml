      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/packlane.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Customer service is often taken for granted. “Just do your job,” they say. “That’s what we’re paying you for,” they say. Not here. At Packlane, we see it as an art form. Because great service—where details matter most, problems get solved (not deflected), and relationships are built—is magical. We know that without the right person representing us on the frontlines, we don’t stand a chance. Our customers come to us because they want the best for their business. And the best starts with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What you’ll do:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Show off your proficient, positive, and proactive personality in every communication with our customers—not just on email, but also on live chat, where thinking-on-your-feet is key.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be a steadfast Know-It-All when it comes to order status, product info, technical issues, pricing and more. And if you don’t know it all, you’ll know how to track it down. Fast.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Keep our customers’ accounts up to date, managing refunds or credits when necessary.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Become our CSSME—Customer Service Subject Matter Expert. In other words, know your stuff, write it down, and make sure it goes viral.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Remember that part about solving (not deflecting) problems? Yeah, that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Who You Are:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Detail obsessed. Like housecleaning with a toothbrush obsessed.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An unapologetic people person. Hugging optional, of course.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reliable. Accountable. Dependable. And all the other good -bles. You know what they are.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A communicator at heart, who appreciates how the right words can soothe even the surliest souls.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiar with printing processes and Adobe Creative Suite.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;BENEFITS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Work from anywhere! This is a full-time, remote position.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Omni Phone Support Human</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/omni.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/omni.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is expanding our band of Support Humans (also known as our Tech Support team). We’re looking for candidates who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our OS X and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have a surprisingly pleasant conversation about software.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Activities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be working with customers who call in or otherwise contact us and need technical help with our Mac and iOS products. If you know the answer to their question, great! If you don’t, gather as much information as you can and work with the other folks here to figure it out so you can get back to them and help.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re looking for candidates who have a positive attitude, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking their way through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t have those binders of troubleshooting scripts some other companies use; your imagination will be one of your most important tools in this job.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You need to enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more once you start working with us.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Compensation and Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We have great customers that love our apps and push them to their limits. Support Humans get the satisfaction of earning their gratitude by helping them out.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We believe that being friendly is at least as important as being smart when it comes to making great software. When you need help with a problem here, you probably know who to ask and you can assume they’ll be happy to talk about it. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At Omni, we may not always agree on the best way to solve the problems we work on, but we pride ourselves on all being on the same team. This is not a workplace where people can further themselves by tearing you down.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support Humans are explicitly included in the process of creating of our products; they’re a valuable source of insight into the needs and concerns of our customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive total compensation package: base salary in the mid-$40k range, a 401k with matching, and the potential for profit sharing based on company profitability.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fully paid health/dental/vision for you and your dependents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Biweekly massages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Free meals prepared by our Executive Chef and the rest of his team. Your SOs are welcome to eat here or you can pack dinner up to take home to your family. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lots of other good stuff, which you can read about elsewhere on this website.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;How to Get This Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;To be considered for this job, the following things &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;must&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be true:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You live in the Seattle area and are able to work with us in our Seattle office, a little bit north of downtown. We’re not looking for remote employees, and we’re not looking to relocate anyone to fill this position. Apologies in advance, but we won’t be making any exceptions on this.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are empathetic, patient, and have a positive attitude, even when helping a customer who is having a very bad day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have strong problem-solving, communication, and customer service skills. You can think your way through problems and enjoy helping our customers solve them. (Even if the problems aren’t well-defined, even if the usual solutions aren’t working, and even if it’s the fifth person you’ve helped solve that problem today.) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You also have the ability to speak up, ask questions, and absorb technical information. You’ll be well supported while you’re learning about our applications, but you need to be the kind of person that asks for help when they need it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are comfortable using and solving problems with Macs, iOS devices, and the apps that run on them. If you’re the person that your relatives ask for help with their Apple Store purchases, that’s a good sign.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you’re not actually an animal person, you should be able to tolerate them in the workplace. Employees bring their dogs to the office on a daily basis.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Special Bonus Lightning Round Extras&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The following things aren’t requirements, but would be nice to mention if they apply to you:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous phone-based tech support experience would be a big plus. General phone-based customer service experience or in-person tech support experience would also be plusses.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience using Terminal commands and/or the ability to comfortably hand-edit XML, HTML, or JavaScript would be another huge plus. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Read or speak a language other than English? We’re listening. :-)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ideal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; candidate would have some experience with our applications. If you haven’t ever used them, go to our website and read about them. If they seem interesting to you, this is a good sign. If you have access to a Mac, download them and play with them. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To apply, send an email to&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:resumes@omnigroup.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;resumes@omnigroup.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; include the exact phrase “Phone Support Human” in the subject line. Include a copy of your résumé in text, HTML, RTF or PDF form.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; if you send your resume as a Word document, you will not be considered for the position. No phone calls or visits to the office, please.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every applicant that sends in a resume before &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;February 22nd&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; will receive a set of sample support questions to work on; applicants will have until &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;February 28th&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to submit responses. Those answers are by far the most important factor we’ll use when selecting applicants to invite in for interviews.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our goal with this hire is to find coworkers that will impress our customers by solving problems better and faster than they expect, that will suggest ways to improve our products so a problem that occurred today is solved tomorrow, and who we’ll enjoy working alongside in this important, meaningful, and deeply silly industry we’ve chosen to devote our careers to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Omni&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is a rewarding but nontraditional place to work, and our compensation packages reflect that. We offer the usual range of traditional benefits to employees:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive salaries, based on experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonuses, based on our revenues and profitability for the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock options. (Note that we are not aiming to become publicly traded.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401(k), with some company matching, again depending on our revenues and profitability for the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full health coverage.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vision and dental coverage.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when we founded this business we knew that we were going to spend a ton of time here, so basic survival dictated that it should be fun as well as easy to work in. To those ends, we also have some less traditional benefits:&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Omni has a professional chef and assistants with the power of a restaurant-grade kitchen at their disposal. Dinner is at five o’clock every weeknight; your SO and kids are welcome, too. If you find eating at the office to be impractical, feel free to pack some food up to take home with you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Personal hardware purchase budget. Omni provides everything you need to get your job done in the office, but if you need an extra 30” display at home we can help with that too.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Professional development budget, which covers conferences, training, or materials that you can convince us will help further your work-related skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Corporate matching of personal contributions to 501(c) non-profits, up to a limit.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A theater, and other media amenities. Miss a WWDC session? Watch it on our hugenormous projector. Fail to watch indie movies when they first came out? Check them out from our movie library!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A whole mess of console video game systems, both current and old-school. There is a dedicated A/V system for the games, so someone can watch Game of Thrones while others play Rock Band. And of course, we have a large suite of board games, D&amp;amp;amp;D goodies, pinball, and other classic paraphernalia.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;On-site massages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, don’t get the impression we just goof around: it takes a lot of hard work to make our products a joy for our customers. Doing what we do, and doing it the way we choose to, is not easy. Luckily, we all love doing what we do, and we hope you will too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Omni is located in rainy Seattle, possibly the most beautiful city in North America. The air here is still clean, the people still friendly, local brands are still more popular than national brands, and music festivals still feel like they are for the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
