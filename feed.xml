      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/kayako.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are recruiting for a Director of Support to head up our customer support team and operations. This is not your usual support lead role.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At Kayako, this is a superstar role in all but having a dressing room*. We lead by example when it comes to how we support our customers. We want to shape the future of customer support, and help our customers get there too. This means constant innovation and experimentation with people, process and product. The right person for this job will be a rapid and passionate learner who wants to do amazing things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you love the prospect of changing the world’s perception of customer support as a short term job opportunity, are excited by the opportunity to develop true thought leadership in the space and the opportunity to build a great software business by placing our customer at the heart of it, you’ve found perfect company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(* OK, dressing room negotiable.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities, goals and things you&amp;#39;d be working on&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lead and grow the Kayako customer support team (based all around the world, with two principal locations being our offices: London and New Delhi.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Plan and deliver projects to level up the Kayako customer experience and drive CSAT and NPS.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with customer success to develop a holistic customer strategy and resources covering contact, operations, tooling, self-service and onboarding to drive customer loyalty, reduce customer effort and customer churn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Day-to-day management of the customer support team including training and development, mentoring, ongoing scheduling of support coverage and the reporting and monitoring of metrics.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with product and marketing to improve the Kayako product offering and value proposition, and help turn the support function into an insights engine.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Develop and own collaborative processes across channels, departments and the Kayako community to improve the support journey for our users.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Build thought leadership by translating our learnings and methodologies into content, blogging, community participation and speaking at events.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Skills, qualifications and experience required&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Minimum of 2 years experience leading and building customer support and service teams specifically for software products, and 4 years experience leading teams generally.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Successful in and being responsible for recruiting, interviewing, compensating and developing talent.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A voracious learner and reader (there is no degree in building the Kayako business - we need to relearn everything we thought we knew, every year.) Kayako is a growth-stage startup. With around nearly 100 people around the world, this is the perfect opportunity to join a still nascent team and shape your own role as we grow.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A consistent track record as a hands-on, cross-functional member of the team who leads from the front, and is always willing to dive in and always able to step back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Very comfortable with wrangling with data and customer metrics.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A solid understanding of the challenges of building a customer support and service functions across different industries and verticals.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent written and oral communication along with technical fluency, CRM and customer communication tool experience, such as Kayako, Salesforce, Hubspot, HootSuite.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Very comfortable working in and coordinating collaboration with other functions and in a team environment.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;d love this role if&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You love working with people and seeing them grow to their full potential with coaching and development.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’d relish the challenge of developing new metrics to measure the customer experience and helping our product team create new tools to improve it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You love working out of silos and are keen to deploy your expertise and expand your knowledge across all areas of the customer journey and product.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You don&amp;#39;t see owning your own territory as a reflection of your individual success, but rather the success of your team and the wins we achieve together.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have ambition to become a thought leader and make a name for yourself as a high performing leader in a fast pace SaaS startup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re already a member of the customer support community (blogging, Elevate Summit, UserConf, Support Driven, etc.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Other reasons why you’ll love working at Kayako&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock options - we want everyone to be invested in the success of their work.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited PTO - take time off as you need it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pension - we’ll contribute to your pension so you can plan for the future.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Private health insurance package - including a 50% discount gym membership, because we want to be and stay healthy.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Choose your own gear - we want you to have all the tools you need to do the work best.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible working hours - we love spending time in the office together and think we’re at our best in-person, but we’re realistic and flexible about it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Family friendly - we operate a childcare vouchers scheme for all our employees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly on-site massage - yes, we have someone come in once a month. No, it’s not weird.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fully stocked fridge and pantry - keeping you going. Standard.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly craft beers and wines - every Friday. No reason or explanation needed. And we won’t judge you if you wanted to start on Thursday, either.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly fruit delivery - to compensate for the weekly beers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weekly team lunches - because we like food, and we love bonding over it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regular learning opportunities - from Lunch n’ Learns to opportunities to attend the best industry events, we want you to grow in every way possible.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Location&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our preference would be for this key leadership role to be based locally in our office in London. We&amp;#39;re happy to sponsor a visa where possible. However, for the right candidate, we will also consider a remote position - significant experience building and managing a global support team remotely would be a requirement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Equal opportunities (it is boilerplate, but we believe it)&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kayako is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability or age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full-time remote position, 40 hours/week&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Like a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence, our marketing team is dedicated to helping people discover something new and exciting - and in our case, that means leading them to Edgar. But what about all those people out there who could use a little extra push? Well, That’s where you come in, dear reader - we’re looking for a User Outreach Specialist who can lead the charge on identifying and nurturing leads, leading product demos, and whatever else our pre-customers might need!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’re a take-charge sort of guy/gal/non-binary individual - somebody who can tell when a person needs a nudge or three in the right direction, and proactively gives them the information they need to make their own brilliant decisions. You’re not a salesperson - you’re a matchmaker, setting people up with bliss-inducing solutions to their most problem-y problems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In this position, that means working with our marketing team to do things like:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Identify and nurture leads via email, social media, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conduct personalized one-on-one demos as needed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond to emails and online chats from our leads&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transition new customers into our onboarding process&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes, the people who’ll benefit most from your help and expertise will come to you - other times, you’ll seek them out yourself. That means you’re someone who understands the weird lil’ intersection of social media, SaaS products, and content marketing where Edgar lives, and the issues that are important to anyone else in that neighborhood. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can you tell when what we offer is what someone’s looking for? How do you communicate that - and how does your strategy change from person to person? What matters most to one type of lead versus another, and how do you help them meet their needs? These are the types of questions you’ll be answering in this position - so be ready! (Sorry, we totally didn’t give you a spoiler alert beforehand.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because this role requires significant interaction with potential customers, you’ll work alongside both our Marketing and Customer Experience teams to make our relationships with our leads better than ever. From conducting proactive outreach to responding to the needs of prospective users, your day-to-day will be the types of one-on-one interactions that a people person’s dreams are made of!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Deets Cheat Sheet&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a full-time, salaried remote position - you must live somewhere in North America and be able to show eligibility to work in the USA&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sales/marketing experience a plus&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Customer service experience also preferred, ideally with technology-related products/services&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An extrovert’s love of reaching out to new people (an introvert’s love of staying at home is okay, though)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to read a situation and determine someone’s needs - even if they don’t spell them out for you&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Confident hosting live demos, Q&amp;amp;amp;A sessions, and sing-a-longs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Demonstrably good judgment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Us&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re a small team of 18-ish people, all working remotely across the US &amp;amp;amp; Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual retreat week where we work together on cool projects all day and rock the karaoke mic all night. (Spoiler alert: This means you have to be willing and able to travel to those retreats! The karaoke, however, is optional.)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;ll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can find out more at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://meetedgar.com/careers/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://meetedgar.com/careers/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and by watching this video (please watch it, it was mad expensive):&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;320&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;180&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvU3P43b0rQ&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Perks &amp;amp;amp; Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam! And yes, everyone actually uses all 4 weeks)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly cleaning service for your home - not that we don&amp;#39;t have total faith in you&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Paid home Internet service&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coworking space/coffee shop working expenses&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coverage for health, dental, and vision for you and your fam&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401(k) with matching&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An extra paid day off per quarter so you can volunteer in your community (awww)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New Mac laptop (#blessed)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Books, conferences, and other educational resources to help you be even more amazing at what you do!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Zapier Customer Champion APAC</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/zapier-apac.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/zapier-apac.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;column two-thirds content secondary-blog-entry-jobs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
         
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Normally we hire candidates for our customer champion team from anywhere in the world. However right now we are in need of someone who can help our customers from 12am UTC to 9am UTC. This roughly corresponds with people who live in Australia and Asia. If you&amp;#39;re excited about this role but your main working hours aren&amp;#39;t in this timezone check out our &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/customer-champion-zapier/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;general customer champion application&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;re looking for someone who loves helping people. If you love interacting with people on a daily basis to help them learn how to optimize their work then read on…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know applying for and taking on a new a job at any company requires a leap of faith. We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier. To help share a bit more about life at Zapier here are a few resources in addition to the job description that can give you an inside look at what life is like at Zapier. Hopefully you&amp;#39;ll take the leap of faith and apply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/our-commitment-to-applicants/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Our Commitment to Applicants&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-remote-working/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zapier Guide to Remote Work&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zapier Code of Conduct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/working-on-diversity-and-inclusivity/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Working on Diversity and Inclusivity&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re empathetic to users and can easily put yourself in their shoes. You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered after interacting with support and not stupid because of a small mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You obsess over the details. Maybe you have a one emoticon and one exclamation point rule of thumb for every email. Maybe it&amp;#39;s only two sentences per paragraph. Either way, you make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes the customer delighted to work with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love solving problems. Every customer is different, many times radically so. You relish being able to meet their specific need, and also solving their problems that may have gone unsaid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to write. Almost everything at Zapier is done via written communication (both with customers and between teammates).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re persistent. Support at Zapier is much different than at many software companies. It&amp;#39;s not the same questions over and over again, and often involves researching technical nuances of the apps we support. You love the opportunity to solve new problems every day and won&amp;#39;t give up when you don&amp;#39;t know the answer right away.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to set your own course. At Zapier, we have quick team meetings each week and one-on-one meetings every month and then we go make things happen. You get to make things happen without someone saying so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Things You Might Do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zapier is a startup, so you&amp;#39;ll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you&amp;#39;ll get to lead:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write documentation to help users help themselves (all the documentation on our help site is written and maintained by the support team: https://zapier.com/help/)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work with the product team to build tools that will speed up and increase the quality of support at the same time&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About Zapier&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the past five years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;The Whole Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Location: Anywhere you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to work remote, that&amp;#39;s cool. If you want to work near others, that&amp;#39;s cool too. The current support team is in Washington, Maryland, Florida, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon, California, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Australia, England, and Spain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compensation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Based on experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Profit sharing&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2-3 annual company retreats to awesome places&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;14 weeks paid leave for new parents&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pick your own equipment. We&amp;#39;ll set you up with whatever laptop + monitor combo you want plus any software you need. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlimited vacation policy (plus we insist you take at least 2 weeks off each year - this isn&amp;#39;t a vague policy where unlimited vacation means no vacation). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Work with awesome companies around the world. We partner with the best software companies in the world and you&amp;#39;ll constantly get to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/zapbook&amp;quot;&amp;gt;interact with people from these great companies&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Set your own destiny.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;How to Apply&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applying is simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.wufoo.com/forms/customer-champion-asiaaustralia-application/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Complete this form with answers to the below questions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us why you&amp;#39;d be a good fit for this role.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us why you want to work at Zapier instead of somewhere else.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What should our goal be when replying to users?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A user requests an integration with a service that we don&amp;#39;t support yet. Compose a reply to this user.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set up a zap that takes new Gmail emails from a specific sender and adds them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.  Send us the link to the zap and a share link for the spreadsheet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send us a link to an app&amp;#39;s API docs that you think are well done, and explain why you think they are good.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Look at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gist.github.com/WadeFoster/0bd294efe54f8fb8a1e7&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this list&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and pick the 5 things that most excite you. Also pick the 5 things that least excite you. Don&amp;#39;t pick by your opinion of importance, this is mostly to see interest/experience. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about Zapier?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Optional: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.wufoo.com/forms/zv5nyxr0ho7nxi/def/Field208=Customer+Happiness&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Share anonymously some demographic information about yourself&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to help us better track trends related to the backgrounds of candidates interested in working at Zapier in order for us to build a team that represents the users at Zapier and the broader world population.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, wait for us to reply. We reply to everyone, even if we don&amp;#39;t seem like a good fit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Zapier is an equal opportunity employer. We&amp;#39;re excited to work with talented and empathetic people no matter their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, physical or mental disability, or age. Our &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;code of conduct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; provides a beacon for the kind of company we strive to be and we celebrate our differences because those differences are what allow us to make a product that serves a global user base.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
