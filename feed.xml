      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Raven&amp;#39;s Customer Success team isn&amp;#39;t just the primary point of contact for Raven Tools customers — we&amp;#39;re their voice to the rest of the company. As a Customer Success Advocate, you will play a critical role in our customers&amp;#39; overall experience of using Raven. When they have questions, bug reports, feature requests or general feedback, you&amp;#39;re on the frontline to lend a hand. But, more than that, you&amp;#39;re empowered to think strategically and work creatively in your day-to-day work. Whether that&amp;#39;s recording how-to videos, writing blog posts and documentation, or perfecting the art of the animated GIF, you&amp;#39;ll have the latitude to make improvements wherever you see opportunities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Success in this role is heavily dependent on:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Relationships: the ability to build strong relationships centered on empathy for others and a strong sense of customer service. Putting yourself in the customer&amp;#39;s shoes, you think ahead to answer their next question before it&amp;#39;s asked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strategic problem solving: working smart, not hard, to improve our customer&amp;#39;s experience of using Raven and contacting our team, as well as to improve our own internal procedures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A growth mindset: you may not be an expert now, but you&amp;#39;re excited to learn and broaden your skills on the job. You have the self-awareness to ask for help and feedback. The ideal candidate for this job role sees themselves as a lifelong learner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate one-on-one with Raven customers through Zendesk, answering their questions and troubleshooting issues&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with our development team on resolving bugs in the software&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create content to improve our customers&amp;#39; experience: technical documentation, blog posts, videos, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Act as the voice of our customers for product decisions and development&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Must live in or around Nashville, Tennessee.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong writing skills and an impeccable attention to detail&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree or equivalent&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with Raven Tools is a huge bonus, but not required&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive salary&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Generous paid vacation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full medical and dental coverage&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opportunities for professional development&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Raven&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Raven is a software company dedicated to making the lives of digital marketers easier and more efficient. We provide two products: a website analysis tool called Site Auditor and the all-in-one marketing reporting platform Raven Tools. Raven runs more than 30,000 reports per month, pulling together data from Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, and more than two dozen other data sources into a single, easy to customize package. Raven is proudly based out of Nashville, Tennessee on historic Cannery Row.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;To Apply&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please send your resume and cover letter to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:lance@raventools.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#64;&amp;amp;#114;&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#118;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#116;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#115;&amp;amp;#x2e;&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x2e;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#64;&amp;amp;#114;&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#118;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#116;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#115;&amp;amp;#x2e;&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x2e;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

It’s support’s job to help issuu to continue to be the best digital publishing platform in the world by ensuring that the customers’ stories are at the forefront of our work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The customer support team feeds into our core objectives by helping to create customer loyalty and community. We ensure that the customer is getting the most out of the product and the publishers are on the right price plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About the Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the leader of the team, you need to be a passionate customer advocate and a great storyteller.

You’re expected to be able to set up processes and select tools, to formulate, document, implement and communicate policies, to establish metrics and build dashboards, to identify opportunities and execute on them. You’ve done it before and you’re excited for the opportunity to build and lead the support for a broad consumer and business base.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You also know that support is a team effort, so training and mentorship are integral to this role. You&amp;#39;ll be expected to get your hands dirty and to lead by example by managing customer inquiries and writing help articles, but you will also be leveling up our support teams as an amplifier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your work will not be limited to your direct team: issuu support works intimately with our marketing, sales, engineering, product, and business intelligence teams on a daily basis. You will serve as a voice and representative of the customer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The office is conveniently located next to the Palo Alto Caltrain station. We provide catered lunches, regular outings and monthly passes for public transit. Our support team is located in Palo Alto and Copenhagen, so you’ll need to be able to travel from time to time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lead the support efforts at issuu. This work consists of:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conducting status reviews.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Continuing and improving support quality, per our organization KPIs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to and help build the future of issuu support. This will involve:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working with our org to create new processes to scale support quality.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working with our product team to shape premium support packages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working within your team and the product and engineering teams to improve our internal tools.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re a self starter. You&amp;#39;re willing to dive into projects and get things done, but in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t alienate your team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have 3 or more years in a support environment for a technical company with 1 or more years in a management capacity. Or 3 years in a product management role dealing with customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be a part of issuu – an amazing place with room for parents, foodies, geeks, odd birds and the occasional normal person&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Informal, inclusive and very flexible workplace&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/captain401.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/captain401.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Captain401 is hiring our first Account Specialist, who will be responsible for ensuring that our customers have an exceptional experience with Captain401. Working closely with our Account Management team, the Account Specialist will build relationships with our customers by handling customer support inquiries (via email and phone) and troubleshooting issues related to our customers&amp;#39; 401(k) retirement accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our customers are at the core of our business, and the Account Specialist&amp;#39;s role is crucial in giving them the best experience possible. You&amp;#39;ll be on the front lines helping people make the most of their 401(k) savings and get on the right path to a secure financial future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This role is at the intersection of operations, sales, and engineering, so the Account Specialist must work well with different parts of the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no typical day in a startup, so you will have to be adaptable — there will be no shortage of interesting challenges to tackle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exceptional phone-based and email-based communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to empathize with customers and a passion for delivering a great customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent organizational skills and task management abilities&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attention to detail —- no issue slips through the cracks&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Minimum 1 year of work experience (experience working in customer-facing role at a startup is a plus)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Passion for solving big problems and having an immediate and positive impact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Industry or domain experience not required&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Our Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an employee benefits company, benefits are very important to us, and Captain401&amp;#39;s philosophy is to be generous when it comes to employees&amp;#39; wellness. Here&amp;#39;s what we currently offer:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A great 401(k) plan: our own! Our 401(k) includes a dollar-for-dollar employer match up to 4% of compensation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Top-of-the-line health insurance plans, as well as dental and vision insurance, with premiums fully paid for by the company.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An annual membership to One Medical Group, with membership fees paid by Captain401.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Commuter benefits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;FSA with an employer contribution of $250 per year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dollar-for-dollar match of employee donations to non-profit 501(c)(3) organizations, up to $500 per year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Healthy snacks and drinks available at our office.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Team retreats and outings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We try not to spend money on “perks” like ping pong tables. We practice what we preach! We believe employer funds are best spent towards investing in the long-term physical, financial, and emotional well-being of our employees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since 2009 we’ve been making it easy for businesses to take care of their customers and sales opportunities. Capsule is now one of the most popular CRM’s for small businesses and sales teams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re a UK based company with an office in central Manchester. We’re open to remote working if you’re outside of Manchester, but you need to be in the UK for this position. You’ll be joining a small, dedicated &amp;amp;amp; friendly team that cares deeply about the customer experience. We offer a start-up style culture with a competitive salary and benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What we’re looking for:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. You will have a positive style and an ability to describe solutions simply&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re able to read between the lines when necessary to minimise emails back-and-forth - helping customers efficiently is key&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You should be self motivated and confident in working independently, but you should also know your limits and when to seek direction&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re a pro at minimising disruptions whether working remotely or in the office and can get through a high volume of well thought out emails each day&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are tech savvy with an interest in web and mobile apps&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous experience using help desk software would be a bonus but not essential&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;A typical week involves:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping existing users get the most out of their Capsule accounts and also highlight the benefits of Capsule to potential users who get in touch via email and Twitter&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Troubleshooting and detailing customer issues for our developers to resolve&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sharing valuable customer feedback with the design and development teams&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Customer Success Guru (£25-28K, Share Options, Work Remotely) </title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/resource-guru.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 4 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/resource-guru.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resource Guru is a leading cloud-based team calendar and leave management app. It’s the fast, simple way to schedule people, equipment and other resources online. We have customers from over 150 countries around the world including Microsoft, Ogilvy, Deloitte, Yahoo!, AT&amp;amp;amp;T, HBO and the NHS. They all trust Resource Guru to handle one of their most precious assets - their people’s time. Resource Guru was founded in 2011 in London and is backed by one of the world’s leading VCs, Index Ventures. Visit &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://resourceguruapp.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://resourceguruapp.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are a remote team with employees across the UK and South Africa. This means you would be free to work from anywhere with a 4 hour overlap with GMT and a good internet connection. We will be happy to pay for coworking space if you need it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;In Brief&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We like our customers to smile when they think of Resource Guru :) We think of customer service as an opportunity to engage with our customers, and wherever possible convert them into brand advocates. Your main role is to make that happen. As well as supporting existing customers, you’ll be dealing with enquiries from potential customers too. You’ll usually be speaking to people via email, but you’ll also be hosting online demos and will occasionally need to jump on the phone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll help to troubleshoot any technical issues our customers face - whether they’re struggling to change their password, or they’ve reported a bug which needs investigating by our engineers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a separate part of the role, you will carry out QA testing prior to feature releases and, because we’re a small startup, you may also be asked to help out in various other areas too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are looking for a radiator, not a drain. Someone who can empathise with others, is passionate about technology, is level headed and has a pragmatic approach to problem solving.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What You’ll Be Doing&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping to manage the day-to-day customer service for Resource Guru and responding to tickets in a timely manner&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conducting customer product demos online&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Testing new features and enhancements prior to release&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There’s always lots to do when you work in a startup, so there’ll be plenty of other stuff to get your teeth stuck into!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What We’re Looking For&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An empathetic, conscientious and resourceful person with experience in customer service&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Someone with patience, an upbeat disposition and a good sense of humour who can turn disgruntled customers into happy ones&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A technically inquisitive and knowledgeable person who delights in helping others, can empathise with their issues and think laterally about how to replicate them&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A rigorous troubleshooter who wants to dig deep and get to know our product inside out&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expensify prides itself on solving real-world problems with a team of top-notch product experts. We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love developing relationships with others and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital maven and love interacting with customers through email, in-product, and sometimes over the phone. Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who can:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintain customer relationships and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written (and verbal) communication.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who&amp;#39;s able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be sometimes repetitive and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is squarely grounded in support, no matter the customer size.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We&amp;#39;re excited to hear from you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
