      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Email will no longer suck. Klaviyo is using technology to reinvent email marketing from the ground up! For far too long email marketing has been pretty selfish. Companies blast everyone with the same email, not because they think that’s what customers want, but because they don’t have a choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Klaviyo fundamentally changes the game. Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it to drive a platform that’s part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that drives results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn’t really changed. We’re here to fix that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Success at Klaviyo&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Success is a super critical function that sits at the intersection of product, sales and marketing. The Success team is at the core of our business! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You Will&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Respond to customer inquiries&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate technical concepts effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Serve as the Klaviyo Product Expert&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to the knowledge base of the Klaviyo Customer Success Team&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with Engineering, Sales and Product to improve customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You Have&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;3+ years in a technical support role&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In depth working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proficiency with APIs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/fastly.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fastly is a flexible, transparent content delivery network that accelerates and scales websites, mobile applications, and APIs. We do this by moving content physically closer to a company’s end users. If you’re tweeting, pinning, shopping on Wayfair or ModCloth, reading the news on Fast Company or The Guardian, browsing pictures on Imgur, or coding with GitHub, Fastly is improving your user experience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The global CDN market is estimated to grow from $3.71 billion in 2014 to $12.16 billion in 2019. With an exciting product roadmap and a fast-growing international team, Fastly is redefining what’s possible online.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re building a better Internet. Come join us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;CUSTOMER SUPPORT ENGINEER&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fastly’s goal of creating the best set of tools for people who scale the internet is rooted in great support. It&amp;#39;s a core value, and something that shapes our culture. Fastly is looking for passionate support engineers to continue our high standard of support, as well scale and improve our support systems as we grow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ideal candidate should be a master of written voice, and have the technical curiosity and experience necessary to understand Fastly’s product from end to end. They’ll be working with our marketing, engineering, and sales teams on behalf of our customer base, so a passion for customer advocacy is essential. Also, no two support tickets at Fastly are alike, so support engineers will be dealing with a wide range of complex and rewarding problems on a daily basis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;RESPONSIBILITIES&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Assist with customer CDN configurations over email and chat&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate customer needs and requirements with the engineering, product and sales teams&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to our customer facing documentation when necessary&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to the processes and policies that scale our support organization as we grow&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong verbal and written communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with a *nix environment
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with one or more programming languages&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to debug connections using cURL, traceroute, telnet and other network diagnostic tools&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior CDN, support, or sysadmin experience a plus&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>ProTrainings Customer Happiness Hero</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/protrainings.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/protrainings.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You...&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Are good at seeing things from other people’s point of view&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strive to take care of others like you would take care of your own family&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Love to build relationships with customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Want to take customer care to the next level&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Emulate other companies that provide amazing service: Disney, Chick-Fil-A, Nordstrom, Ritz-Carlton, Trader Joe’s, and Zappos are some great examples&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See the value in having a rabid, loyal customer base&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Embrace change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Push for excellence&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Who we are&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve been certifying people in CPR, first aid, and bloodborne pathogens since 2003. Not only that -- we’ve been increasing in size, training more people, adding more trainings, and getting bigger and stronger every year since.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are a collaborative, growing team that creates and supports the world’s best training. Our online health and safety courses help save lives every day (literally -- we have heard countless stories from our customers who have saved the lives of loved ones after using our training).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We work out of an awesome, open building in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we believe&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Providing life-saving training is a noble pursuit that is worth getting up every morning to create.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that every team member is crucial and makes a difference, which is why we hire highly-motivated, hard-working, well-rounded people who pursue excellence in everything they do. That’s also why we’re very selective and particular about hiring great people, especially in this position, as you will be the face of our company to many of our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We think that surprising and delighting our customers at every turn makes life-long, loyal supporters who rave about you to their friends; not to mention, it helps make the world a better place to live!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that training should be FREE, because nobody should have to take out their wallet to learn how to save a life. In fact, we believe this so strongly, we created a StudentCPR program that trains thousands of high school students every single year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that you can work really hard and still have a ton of fun. You can play ping pong to blow off steam, chat with customers from our ceiling suspended hammock chair, and play games with co-workers at the office at night. Work and fun are not mutually exclusive -- having a good work-life balance is critical to loving your job and doing great work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We love innovation. We don’t like to do things like everyone else. A great example is our Single Use Manikin Option (SUMO). For the first time in the history of CPR training, people are able to complete their entire certification without leaving home.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What you’ll be doing&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Delighting our customers by forming real relationships with them (through phone, email, and chat), including sending out postcards and follow-up emails to show our appreciation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Forming meaningful relationships with company administrators (Nike, Bed Bath &amp;amp;amp; Beyond, Goodwill, and Jazzercise are just a few companies that use us) while assisting them with setup, onboarding, and follow-up&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Providing insightful advice and friendly support to ProTrainings customers in need&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Quickly diagnosing problems on the spot, determining and explaining situations with patience and empathy so our customers can get trained and get back to work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Taking ownership of every customer interaction -- we empower you to make decisions and care for customers in creative ways -- no robots here&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborating with other departments to WOW our customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learning and growing professionally by taking time every week to read articles or books from our bookshelf to better yourself&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working 12pm - 8pm or 9am - 5pm (EST) with the possibility of alternating shift coverage&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We are open to remote workers who have a great work ethic, are self-motivated, and do great work without direct supervision&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Desired experience&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have worked in a customer-relations role in the past, whether that was as a receptionist, a call center rep, nursing assistant, barista, bank teller, anything in retail, or any other position in which you helped and delighted customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Basic skills we’re looking for&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong writing skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong people skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A good speaking voice&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to maintain composure and customer focus while troubleshooting and solving technical issues&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comfortable with technology&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fast typer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comfortable on phone, email, and chat&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fast learner&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attention to detail&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus if you are able to speak Spanish (at least at a high school level) and interested in learning more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits you’ll love&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Health / dental insurance&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Paid time off&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401k with company match&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fun culture / atmosphere&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A career that makes a difference (train people to save lives, hear heroic stories, and receive awesome testimonials from really grateful customers)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High level of autonomy and creativity while helping and delighting customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Extensive, continuous training (you won’t be thrown in blind)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Professional development library (request a book or resource, and you’ll have it within 2 weeks)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CPR / first aid training &amp;amp;amp; certification&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Ready to help save lives?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re still reading this, we would love to learn more about you. Shoot an email to careers at protrainings dot com and include the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A fun, catchy subject line&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your top 3 strengths&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A time that you went above and beyond to help someone (preferably in a work setting, but a personal interaction is fine)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Why you want to work at ProTrainings&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your résumé&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Stretch Internet Customer Champion</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/stretch-internet.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 9 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/stretch-internet.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are you interested in genuinely helping people on a daily basis? Do you understand what it means to truly deliver a world class customer experience?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At Stretch Internet, our above-all-else focus on supporting our clients defines who we are as a company. We empower our support specialists, daily, to help us establish and deliver on our industry-leading brand of customer service. We’ve been providing streaming services for collegiate athletic departments for more than 12 years and we are the largest streaming provider in the industry, with a client base of more than 500 colleges and universities. We’re looking for team members that can take a new topic, become an expert on it – with training provided, of course – and apply that expertise in a way that truly dazzles (think virtual jazz hands). If you get excited by the prospect of working around sports for a living and appreciate the idea of working on a small, but close-knit team, this could be the job for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You are:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An outstanding communicator (both written and spoken) – think 9 or better on a scale of 1 to 10&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to quickly and efficiently communicate with coworkers in an often fast-paced environment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The person in your circle of friends that everybody seeks out when they’re having an issue with technology&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Appreciative of spectacular service and recognize what sets it apart from the average interaction&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Someone who ascribes to our seven key values as outlined above – especially the first two (“Be kind” and “Be positive”)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to put anyone at ease through natural, easy-going conversation (If you’re on an airplane for three hours, you can navigate that fine line of friendly conversation vs. endless badgering)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A cool customer - you never get rattled and your friends often wonder if there’s anything that could make you angry&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Self-motivated – when there is downtime, you are not sitting idly by… you would rather find something new to learn or tinker with&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You have:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At least 1-2 years of experience in some field involving customer service interaction and/or high-capacity communication&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Willingness to work at least 1-3 nights per week and full shifts on Saturdays (from late August through May) and occasional Sunday shifts&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience working with Macs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A desire to develop and nurture client relationships&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Openness to being taught &amp;amp;amp; coached – while we encourage our staff to insert their personality (one of our core values is “Be Yourself”), we do have a well-developed voice that we want each of our support specialists to embrace&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Why Stretch?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We think Stretch is a pretty awesome place to work, and we think you might agree. Check out some of the perks we offer:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Laid back environment - wear shorts and flip flops to the office if that’s your thing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- We have fun on a daily basis – ping-pong, darts, pool, sports… somehow we still manage to get work done&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Fully stocked kitchen and catered lunches on Saturdays&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Flexible vacation (3 weeks plus option to buy additional vacation in the summer)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Optional benefits include health insurance and retirement account with employee match&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 6 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/code-climate.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Code Climate is the world&amp;#39;s largest static analysis platform, helping over 50,000 developers improve the health of their codebases. We work hard to provide clear, timely and actionable insights derived from source code. We recently launched the Code Climate Platform, the first open, extensible platform for all types of static analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Code Climate is available on our hosted platform for free for open source projects, and offers paid subscriptions to analyze private source code either on our hosted platform or Code Climate Enterprise, our behind the firewall product. Our customers include Fortune 500s, public and private companies, large and small, with a range of technical sophistication and exposure to static analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Customer Success Manager you’ll work with customers to help them achieve their software goals, primarily (but not necessarily exclusively) using Code Climate. You’ll also work closely with our engineering and customer service teams as a voice for these customers within the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a key part of the external face of Code Climate, we&amp;#39;re looking for someone who is invested in the success of our customers, and represents our values well by putting customers first and executing rigorously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Examples of problems you&amp;#39;ll be solving:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Becoming an active and positive collaborator in the customer’s mission to better improve their code and software development processes by learning about their unique goals, successes and challenges.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Navigating organizations to determine who are the influencers and decision makers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Training clients and promoting wider and deeper Code Climate adoption within their organizations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Educating customers with unique software development processes and environments about the best way to use Code Climate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Concierge onboarding for customers with large teams of developers to ensure smooth integration of Code Climate into their organization&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Integrating Code Climate into an organization’s existing IT environment -- including source code management, code review tools, and collaboration tools like Trello and Slack.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Diagnosing issues affecting customers and collaborating with the product engineering team to identify solutions (and creatively suggesting workarounds, when necessary).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re awesome because:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You elicit glowing testimonials from customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You communicate clearly, concisely and honestly. Customers trust you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You empathize with issues customers face and are compelled to solve them.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You continually advocate internally on behalf of customers, and can name from memory the problems that our biggest customers face.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re never afraid to strike up a conversation with someone new, online or in person.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re comfortable having discussions with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re able to navigate complex organizations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re technologically curious and always learning.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Working at Code Climate&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Join a small team of around fifteen full-time people who love what they do.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive compensation and meaningful stock options.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible and generous paid time off including an open vacation policy and maternity/paternity leave.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Health, dental and vision insurance. We pay 100% of the premium and 50% of the premium for dependents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Company retreats twice a year. So far we&amp;#39;ve gone to Bali and San Diego.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opportunities to continue your professional development, including attending tech conferences.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dog-friendly office stocked with snacks, drinks and cold-brew iced coffee.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expensify prides itself on solving real-world problems with a team of top-notch product experts. We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you will be focused on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify to solve the problems they face. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. You’ll also gather feedback on how we can evolve Expensify to meet our customer’s needs in the future, and apply your product knowledge to map out these improvements for engineering. When product changes happen, you’ll lead the charge via documentation, blog posts, emails, calls and in-person visits with our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you will be working in our fast-paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most-discussed perk is our offshore, where we spend a month abroad working as a team from a remote location. Last year we went to Cambodia and Thailand. Where do you want to go next?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’re an entrepreneur who enjoys thinking through challenging problems, working across functional groups and articulating yourself in both technical and non-technical settings. You’re poised and confident when talking to customers and can always find the time to work with your colleagues to get any issue resolved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Has excellent communication skills. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, the next moment need to communicate how we are going to sell this feature with a member of the sales team, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in all scenarios.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is passionate about building, maintaining and making our software better. It’s what we do as a company.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Can manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is comfortable learning from peers in an informal fashion. After all, we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who&amp;#39;s able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is well-versed in saying “no”. We often have to say no to ensure that our product stays simple and user-friendly. Saying no and having a compelling argument as to why requires in-depth product knowledge and knowledge of the problem that the customer is trying to solve and is critical to success in this role.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Describe a scenario where you interacted with an irate person. How were you able to turn them around (assuming you were able to)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What was your first customer support position? What did you support, and what was your personal take on the product and how best to support it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were given free reign to choose the optimal set of customer support tools, what would they be and how would they optimize your customer success approach? (Feel free to list actual sales tools you’ve used, or fictitious ones. You’ve got free reign).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Describe the angriest customer you have had to support, and how were you able to turn them around? (Assuming you were able to!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
