      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/zapier.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/zapier.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Hi there!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;re looking for someone who loves &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;helping people&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, solving &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tricky technical challenges&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;developing internal tools&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to join us as our second dedicated support engineer. If you love interacting with people on a daily basis to help them optimize their work just as much as you love diving deep into code to build features and squash bugs, please read on!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even though this job description may make it seem like we&amp;#39;re looking for a specific candidate, each role inevitably ends up tailored to the person. We&amp;#39;re always looking for great people. Regardless of how well you feel you fit the description, we encourage you to apply if you care deeply about building products that simplify the lives of millions of people through automation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love helping people.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You have empathy for other people and can easily put yourself in their shoes. You recognize that people have different skill sets and that everyone makes mistakes and needs help sometimes. You enjoy directly interacting with people who need assistance and do so in way that leaves them smiling afterwards. You don&amp;#39;t take things personally and are good at de-escalating situations when people are frustrated. You are good at explaining technical issues to people who don&amp;#39;t have the same technical aptitude you do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love figuring things out.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You enjoy being presented with situations that don&amp;#39;t have an immediately obvious answer and relish finding the solution. You are excited, not intimidated, by problems you don&amp;#39;t know the answer to. You love applying the things you have learned to unfamiliar situations in order to see the deeper patterns that connect seemingly disparate issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love code and APIs.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You are proficient at reading and writing code and genuinely enjoy making and maintaining software. You’ve worked with many APIs and have a fundamental understanding of how they work. You have a solid intuition for what could be causing an API to respond to a request with an error, and you know the little tricks you can employ to get misbehaving requests back on track. You&amp;#39;re comfortable working with code and logs to diagnose, fix, and safeguard against API issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love building tools.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You are excited by the opportunity to build internal tools such as chrome extensions, CLIs, and web apps that make you and your teammates more effective and efficient. You enjoy iterating based on constructive feedback from your co-workers to make everyone&amp;#39;s tools awesome.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love doing things efficiently.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You are constantly looking for ways to use computers to become more efficient. You get excited about saving clicks, keystrokes, and brain cycles with tools like Alfred and Text Expander.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love learning.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You recognize that engineering is always changing and there will always be more to learn, and that is part of why you enjoy it so much. You think experimenting with new tech is fun.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love variety.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You would enjoy a multifaceted role that interacts with a wide variety of people, topics, and issues. The idea of seeing something new and different every day is invigorating. You are able to learn and act quickly to keep up with rapidly changing and sometimes unfamiliar situations. You can balance a variety of projects and responsibilities without getting overwhelmed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love communicating through writing.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You have a very strong command of written English and enjoy communicating extensively through writing. Your writing is concise but effective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You love being part of a team.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You enjoy working with other people and contributing to something bigger than yourself. You are committed to building others up. You make everyone around you better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About Zapier&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the past five years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use and love.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that with the right tools, you can have more impact with less hassle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy, less management, and more getting things done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that great customer service makes great products. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-customer-support/everyone-on-support/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Everyone does support at Zapier&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; because when everyone does support, everyone puts the customer at the center of their role.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that degrees and credentials don&amp;#39;t say everything. What you love doing and what you are good at are way more important than the credentials you have.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. All teammates at Zapier agree to a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;code of conduct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Things You&amp;#39;ll Do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zapier is a startup and this is a hybrid role, so you&amp;#39;ll be involved in a variety of projects around the company. That said, here are some of the things you&amp;#39;ll get to focus on as a Support Engineer here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experiment -- this is a startup so everything can change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;The Whole Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Location: Planet Earth&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to work remote, that&amp;#39;s cool.

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Happiness Engineer, helping people is your passion. Maybe you’ve developed your own support philosophy by reading books like Delivering Happiness or Exceptional Service, Exceptional Profit. Perhaps you’re a contributor in an online support community such as the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transforming publishing on the web is no small task. Our goal is to build relationships based on trust which result in happy, passionate, loyal customers and colleagues. We do this through listening to their needs and guiding them to the fullest use of the products we offer. We are looking for people with the right mix of compassion, writing skills, and technical knowledge to get the job done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;In general, a typical day involves:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping people use Automattic’s products, including &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Gravatar, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Troubleshooting, investigating, and creating detailed bug reports&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Crafting and editing helpful support documentation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Being an active member of a team that provides around the clock support to our users via live chat, forums, and email&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building a community of support by sharing knowledge and insight amongst team members&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Being a Happiness Engineer requires:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Patience, grace, and a sense of humor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent writing and communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working knowledge of WordPress, HTML, and CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A knack for taking technical language and making it understandable&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A passion for solving tough problems and proposing elegant solutions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happiness Engineers must be fluent and eloquent in written English. If you know additional languages, be sure to tell us!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums are fantastic places to gain the experience required for this position.
