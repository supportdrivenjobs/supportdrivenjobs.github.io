      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The GitHub Accounts Support team is looking for a full-time team member who is based in the Asia Pacific region. This person will join GitHub as part of our global support team and support our customers around the world. This is the current list of countries in which we are set up as an employer in the Asia Pacific region, so legal working authorisation is required: Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When GitHub users have questions, they email support. We help people as quickly and awesomely as possible. Our Account Support team handle passwords, email verification, billing, legal, spam and abuse, account lockouts, fraud, and helping people choose plans. This requires a logical brain and a spidey sense for solving problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most important characteristic of our support team is that we love helping developers. GitHub is a place for people to work better, together. Our job is to help. Support treats users the way we&amp;#39;d want someone to treat our friends.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our support teammates have excellent writing chops: stellar grammar, charming written personality, and the ability to explain complicated things simply. We measure our success in swiftness, accuracy, and clarity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers: this probably isn&amp;#39;t the job for you, but perhaps you have a friend who would be a perfect fit. Send them this link. Thanks!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Minimum Qualifications:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Currently residing in Japan, Australia or New Zealand.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stellar English and grammar skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A unique writing style and voice&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent problem solving skills – you might not know all of the answers, but you know how to find and communicate the solution&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A strong sense of empathy and the ability to advocate for others&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior customer support experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Technical experience (QA, documentation, elaborate boardgames)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Preferred Qualifications:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;GitHub is looking for full-time Enterprise Support Engineers to provide Japanese-language support for our customers in Japan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More and more companies are using GitHub Enterprise, so our global Enterprise Support Team is quickly growing. When our customers have problems, they contact us and it is our goal to help them as quickly, and awesomely as possible. We&amp;#39;re looking for Japanese language Enterprise Support Engineers to join our Asia Pacific Support team. This role is remote, but candidates must currently be located in Australia, Japan, or New Zealand and possess legal working authorization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At GitHub, we take support seriously, and this is not an entry-level position. Our Enterprise Support Engineers are responsible for helping our GitHub Enterprise customers who have our product installed and managed in the customer&amp;#39;s virtualization environment. Your main responsibility will be to work with our customers to solve support tickets. Tickets are usually opened by internal system administrators, and can include investigating load or networking issues, debugging application errors, and discussing feature requests. You&amp;#39;ll also work with our engineering team to prioritize issues and development, and our documentation team to improve customer-facing resources. You don’t need to be a Git expert, but you do need to have technical experience and a passion for helping people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The position reports to an Enterprise Support Manager and works closely with other teams and leaders across the company. GitHub works remotely and asynchronously as much as possible. While this role does not require you to live near one of our offices, it will require some travel to meet with co-workers or attend company events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Solve complex customer support tickets often involving Linux servers, source code, and web application issues&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Effectively communicate technical information to customers and engineering groups at GitHub&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work proactively with customers on activities such as coordinating upgrades, communicating upcoming features, and ensuring their installation is running smoothly&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Identify bugs and improvements in the GitHub Enterprise codebase&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage urgent customer outages during business hours&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Minimum Qualifications:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Current legal working authorization in Japan&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with Linux&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;General understanding of how modern web applications work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior experience providing technical support&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent problem-solving skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with some flavor of production-level virtual machine (e.g., VMware ESX, Xen, KVM)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Enthusiasm for working directly with customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stellar Japanese and grammar skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Business level English skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Preferred Qualifications:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Worked closely with large complex customer accounts&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with Git and GitHub&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with phone support&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The ability to look through and understand code (Ruby / Bash)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous experience as a Linux System Administrator&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous experience providing on-site consulting or professional services&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>SolarWinds Cloud (Librato, Papertrail, &amp; Pingdom) Product Advocate / Technical Account Manager</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/solarwinds-cloud.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/solarwinds-cloud.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Product Advocate, you’ll use technical experience, product knowledge, and sales skills to help every customer get the most value from SolarWinds’ Monitoring Cloud (SaaS) products:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Librato (infrastructure monitoring): &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.librato.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://www.librato.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Papertrail (log-centric troubleshooting): &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://papertrailapp.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://papertrailapp.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pingdom (Web performance): &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.pingdom.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://www.pingdom.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;TraceView (application performance monitoring) : &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://traceview.solarwinds.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://traceview.solarwinds.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’ve made a restaurant reservation, collaborated in a text chat room, or purchased a plane ticket, you probably used a service which depends on SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Why is this role important?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your customers, many of whom are fellow engineers, will come to see you as a trusted peer. You’ll be instrumental in figuring out what types of technical account management actually help, why, and how to scale it. This is an incredibly fast-growing market. As the SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud thrives and expands in the coming years, you’ll have contributed significantly to that growth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Why is this position unique?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Big company benefits and customer base, startup flexibility. As Product Advocate, you’ll:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;be the primary contact for your customers, not just a sales engineer. If you’re equally adept at cloning a git repo as you are at explaining why a product is valuable enough to pay for, this role is for you.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;have an unusual amount of control over which actions may be worth your time. We’ll be brainstorming, selecting, and testing these together.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;see the impact of your work every day – not in 0.1% of customers, but in 10% or 30% of customers. If something is demonstrably effective, you’ll help implement or share it widely.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;sell products that you’d actually use yourself. Life is too short to represent a product you don’t care about.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;sell products which already have thousands of satisfied customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;interact with customers using newer technologies like Docker, Go, React, and Kubernetes as well as established products like PostgreSQL, nginx, and Heroku.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Qualifications&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Technical expertise, so you can be useful to software developers and systems engineers. Perhaps you’ve been a sales engineer, customer success engineer, technical account manager or thrived in a “dev bootcamp” program. Maybe you’re writing code now and want a change.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to confidently explain that something costs money (and why!), and ideally, past experience in a sales role. If you have a demonstrated interest in business (like sales, entrepreneurship, or finance), even as a hobby, we want to hear.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re great at explaining complex ideas in writing. This position is 80% email or text, 20% interactive (voice or video)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Able to confidently give a screenshare-style product demo that attendees enjoy&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You value the chance to help define the process. In past roles, maybe you’ve had strong opinions about how sales could do a better job or how you could do a better job if you were the sales rep.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nice to have: Experience interacting with engineers on a daily basis (such as by selling a product to engineers or supporting a product used by engineers), and/or working with a distributed team (such as in Slack)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Examples of technical expertise&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of this job is identifying customer-specific use cases and opportunities where these products can be more helpful and thus get used more. These are usually technical conversations. To add value, you’ve probably done at least 1 of these 5 tasks or something very similar:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;modified a Ruby, Python, Unix shell, or other script/code to do what you want or run correctly (or, of course, written your own)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;cloned a git repo and committed a change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;used a somewhat advanced command-line tool like tcpdump, strace, ntop, iptables, or awk&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;booted a Docker container or EC2/Xen instance&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;configured a daemon like rsyslog or sshd&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Want to stand out?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sign up for a SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud product (like Librato, Papertrail, or Pingdom), then write an email or record a screencast demo for an imaginary customer. In the email or screencast, explain why this product is a better fit than competitors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Dave Customer Success Lead &amp; Social Media Marketing</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/dave.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/dave.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ever found yourself paying $40 for a cup of coffee (and you’re not insane) then you’re already familiar with the problem we’re trying to solve - overdrafts. Dave.com outsmarts overdrafts by predicting your future expenses and unlocking your upcoming paycheck. Instead of charging interest or predatory fees, Dave lets users decide what is fair to pay in an effort to disrupt the $38bn in overdraft fees banks collected in 2016 alone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s right. 0% interest. All we ask is that you tip us if we helped you. It was a crazy social experiment based on the belief that people are inherently good. We are happy to report that this is the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That said, compassion for others is key to our company culture and hopefully a value you cherish. Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your role is crucial as it informs everything we do - from marketing to product development. You are our eyes and ears on the ground. You&amp;#39;ll not only help with customer support but you&amp;#39;ll also take an active lead in crafting our voice on social media. By talking directly with customers, you&amp;#39;ll develop insight as to exactly who our target audience is and how best to communicate with them to help serve their needs. One hand feeds the other.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are started by a 4X entrepreneur ($85mm exit) and are backed by investors like Mark Cuban, SV Angel, The Chernin Group, David Friedberg, The Kraft Group, SRI, Diplo and more. We have great healthcare, cute office dogs, a patio to get your daily intake of Vitamin D and a basketball hoop to get you from slouching. But more important than all this stuff, we’re sick of people getting ripped off by banks and predatory lenders. We’re not a budgeting app. That’s for rich people. We’re here to help the majority of Americans living between the coasts. But it’s cool, we love LA and hope you do too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;REQUIREMENTS:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior experience in tech support, banking or insurance is a big plus.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent grammar and communication skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social media marketing experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be a good human being.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you’ll support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. You’re on the front lines to interact with our customers via email and chat predominantly, but we also sprinkle in phone calls and the occasional in-person visit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging work environment. You thrive as an individual contributor and you know how to get shit done. Still wondering whether this is the right role for you? The most successful candidates can:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things change all the time, especially with the product.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company everyday, even if that value is created in a repetitive and not so glamorous way. #oneteamonedream&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about a bug or product flow that’s confusing for our customers, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:jobs@expensify.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We&amp;#39;re excited to hear from you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
