      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is growing our band of Support Humans (also known as our Tech Support team). Our search is for coworkers who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our macOS and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have surprisingly pleasant conversations about software.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We look for hires with positivity, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t rely on binders of troubleshooting scripts; your imagination will be one of your most important tools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Activities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When customers call with questions about our Mac &amp;amp;amp; iOS apps, you’re their first contact. Know the answer? Great! If not, gather information and we’ll help you find it. (You should enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more here.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it comes to inventing great software, we believe being friendly is at least as important as being smart. If you need help with a problem, you’ll have plenty of people to ask - and they’ll be happy to talk about it. When we disagree, we do it respectfully. No one furthers themselves by tearing you down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Compensation and Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our amazing customers love our apps and push them to their limits. If earning gratitude by helping them brings you happiness, you’ll enjoy this job. We depend on Support Humans when crafting our products; they speak for and represent our customers’ needs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We offer a base salary in the mid-$40k/year range, a 401k with matching, incredible insurance for you and your family, and the potential for profit sharing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We know our industry has a diversity problem; we’re trying to be part of the solution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also offer lots of other great benefits, which you can read about elsewhere on our website. Please see the full job posting and instructions for applying at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;To Apply&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To apply, send email to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:resumes@omnigroup.com&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#114;e&amp;amp;#115;&amp;amp;#x75;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#64;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#x6d;n&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#114;o&amp;amp;#117;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#46;c&amp;amp;#111;m&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#114;e&amp;amp;#115;&amp;amp;#x75;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#64;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#x6d;n&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#114;o&amp;amp;#117;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#46;c&amp;amp;#111;m&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; include the exact phrase “Phone Support Human” in the subject line. Include a copy of your résumé in text, HTML, RTF or PDF form. Please note: if you submit a Word document, you will not be considered for the position. No phone calls or visits to the office, please. Every applicant that sends a resume before May 15th will receive a set of sample support questions to work on; applicants will have until May 22nd to submit responses. Those answers are by far the most important factor we’ll use when selecting applicants to invite in for interviews.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>SkyVerge Customer Support Specialist</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/skyverge.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 3 May 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/skyverge.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hiya. We’re SkyVerge and we love eCommerce. Our products help merchants manage and grow their online stores, all the way from boutique corner shop to Fortune 500 retailers. We’re looking for two Customer Support Specialists to join our fully-distributed team and help support our entire suite of products.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;The Role&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll be the first point of contact for our customers, helping them with problems, and answering questions. As part of a small team, you&amp;#39;ll likely get your hands dirty with a little bit of everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some things you may do on a given day:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Assist customers by troubleshooting technical problems and escalating to the engineering team as needed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Answer pre-sales questions, billing &amp;amp;amp; account changes, and other feedback from customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monitor social media and forums where customers may have questions or issues with our products and get them the help they need&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help with customer onboarding by installing and modifying code on customers’ stores&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write technical documentation and other content so customer’s can help themselves&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help our engineering &amp;amp;amp; product teams to identify areas where we can improve the customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Document and optimize our support process to improve customer satisfaction&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With over 70 products across the three eCommerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads) that we support, there&amp;#39;s plenty to learn. You’ll be expected to own the support queue for a set of products for a week before rotating to another set. We’re aiming for you to have broad knowledge (mile-wide, inch-deep) and work closely with the product &amp;amp;amp; engineering team to tackle more technical or in-depth questions that go beyond your knowledge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have that unique combination of technical aptitude and empathy for the user. You’re comfortable with code but prefer to be customer-facing. You’re self-driven with a sense of urgency and draw satisfaction from going above and beyond to provide solutions. You’re an excellent communicator and have the ability to thrive in a distributed environment. Perhaps most importantly, you have a willingness to learn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To succeed in this position, you will have:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;solid understanding of HTML / CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working knowledge of JavaScript&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Native-level fluency in English (Are you fluent in other languages? Tell us! We love being able to support customers in their native language.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Outstanding written communication and interpersonal skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Boundless curiosity for our products and our customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to thrive in a remote environment (along with a reliable internet connection)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s helpful if you have:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with PHP / Ruby (or other programming languages)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with WordPress&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience with Shopify / WooCommerce (or other eCommerce platforms)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience supporting SaaS products&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience supporting downloadable software (especially in the LAMP stack)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, GitHub, and weekly stand-ups on Monday via Zoom (a few short meetings on Monday) — we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that’s free of distractions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a remote team, we believe that regular meet-ups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. Curious about these trips? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip) to get an idea of what they’re like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with thoughtful replies to customers, wiki edits, and published documentation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Process&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Qualified candidates will get an email with a few questions to answer via email. Following that, you’ll have a few 30 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this goes well, we’ll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day Bootcamp. This is a trial period where you’ll work full-time as a contractor, or part-time on nights/weekends if you already have a full-time position. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. We’ll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure we’re on the same page. At the end of the 30 days, you’ll be offered a permanent position 🙂&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some benefits we&amp;#39;re excited to offer to our team members:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive salary&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;25 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June 😀)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The tools (hardware/software) you need to be productive&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Home office or co-working allowance&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A Kindle to help you keep learning&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/raven-tools.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Raven&amp;#39;s Customer Success team isn&amp;#39;t just the primary point of contact for Raven Tools customers — we&amp;#39;re their voice to the rest of the company. As a Customer Success Advocate, you will play a critical role in our customers&amp;#39; overall experience of using Raven. When they have questions, bug reports, feature requests or general feedback, you&amp;#39;re on the frontline to lend a hand. But, more than that, you&amp;#39;re empowered to think strategically and work creatively in your day-to-day work. Whether that&amp;#39;s recording how-to videos, writing blog posts and documentation, or perfecting the art of the animated GIF, you&amp;#39;ll have the latitude to make improvements wherever you see opportunities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Success in this role is heavily dependent on:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Relationships: the ability to build strong relationships centered on empathy for others and a strong sense of customer service. Putting yourself in the customer&amp;#39;s shoes, you think ahead to answer their next question before it&amp;#39;s asked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strategic problem solving: working smart, not hard, to improve our customer&amp;#39;s experience of using Raven and contacting our team, as well as to improve our own internal procedures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A growth mindset: you may not be an expert now, but you&amp;#39;re excited to learn and broaden your skills on the job. You have the self-awareness to ask for help and feedback. The ideal candidate for this job role sees themselves as a lifelong learner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Communicate one-on-one with Raven customers through Zendesk, answering their questions and troubleshooting issues&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with our development team on resolving bugs in the software&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create content to improve our customers&amp;#39; experience: technical documentation, blog posts, videos, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Act as the voice of our customers for product decisions and development&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Must live in or around Nashville, Tennessee.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong writing skills and an impeccable attention to detail&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree or equivalent&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with Raven Tools is a huge bonus, but not required&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive salary&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Generous paid vacation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full medical and dental coverage&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opportunities for professional development&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Raven&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Raven is a software company dedicated to making the lives of digital marketers easier and more efficient. We provide two products: a website analysis tool called Site Auditor and the all-in-one marketing reporting platform Raven Tools. Raven runs more than 30,000 reports per month, pulling together data from Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, and more than two dozen other data sources into a single, easy to customize package.

We help bridge the gap between what the customer situation is and how the product is able to help them. It’s the job of the customer support team to help our customers achieve their goals using issuu. It’s support’s job to help issuu to continue to be the best digital publishing platform in the world by ensuring that the customers’ stories are at the forefront of our work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The customer support team feeds into our core objectives by helping to create customer loyalty and community. We ensure that the customer is getting the most out of the product and the publishers are on the right price plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About the Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the leader of the team, you need to be a passionate customer advocate and a great storyteller. Our support team is customer-driven and data-informed, so you need to be equally comfortable with numbers and words.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This job is for a doer. You’re expected to be able to set up processes and select tools, to formulate, document, implement and communicate policies, to establish metrics and build dashboards, to identify opportunities and execute on them. You’ve done it before and you’re excited for the opportunity to build and lead the support for a broad consumer and business base.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You also know that support is a team effort, so training and mentorship are integral to this role. You&amp;#39;ll be expected to get your hands dirty and to lead by example by managing customer inquiries and writing help articles, but you will also be leveling up our support teams as an amplifier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your work will not be limited to your direct team: issuu support works intimately with our marketing, sales, engineering, product, and business intelligence teams on a daily basis. You will serve as a voice and representative of the customer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The office is conveniently located next to the Palo Alto Caltrain station. We provide catered lunches, regular outings and monthly passes for public transit. Our support team is located in Palo Alto and Copenhagen, so you’ll need to be able to travel from time to time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lead the support efforts at issuu. This work consists of:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Handling support tickets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developing support procedures.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Defining and performing processes.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Writing and reviewing help center articles.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Work with our VP of product to manage the US and European support teams. This work consists of:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mentoring and growing the individuals on your team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ensuring quality control.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conducting status reviews.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Continuing and improving support quality, per our organization KPIs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to and help build the future of issuu support. This will involve:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working with our org to create new processes to scale support quality.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working with our product team to shape premium support packages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working within your team and the product and engineering teams to improve our internal tools.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Interface with other teams throughout issuu, including our marketing, sales, product, and engineering groups.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Minimum Qualifications&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You should have experience in training support team members, and the ability to connect with all types of learning and working styles.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re a self starter. You&amp;#39;re willing to dive into projects and get things done, but in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t alienate your team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have 3 or more years in a support environment for a technical company with 1 or more years in a management capacity. Or 3 years in a product management role dealing with customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re highly organized. Your team can count on you across timezones.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have excellent English written language skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have the diplomacy required to interface with every team in issuu.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a proven track record of highly-professional, yet highly-personalized customer service and interaction.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have opinions on the state of customer support in our industry, and you have ideas on how to raise the bar.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Preferred Qualifications&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience working with geographically dispersed teams.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience in sales or sales support.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience in a startup environment.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience scaling teams.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What We Offer&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be a part of issuu – an amazing place with room for parents, foodies, geeks, odd birds and the occasional normal person&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Informal, inclusive and very flexible workplace&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive compensation package&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flat hierarchy – every opinion matters regardless of team and position&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A sleek Mac and a pretty sweet desk setup&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Great offices in Copenhagen, Palo Alto and Berlin&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/captain401.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/captain401.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Captain401 is hiring our first Account Specialist, who will be responsible for ensuring that our customers have an exceptional experience with Captain401. Working closely with our Account Management team, the Account Specialist will build relationships with our customers by handling customer support inquiries (via email and phone) and troubleshooting issues related to our customers&amp;#39; 401(k) retirement accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our customers are at the core of our business, and the Account Specialist&amp;#39;s role is crucial in giving them the best experience possible. You&amp;#39;ll be on the front lines helping people make the most of their 401(k) savings and get on the right path to a secure financial future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This role is at the intersection of operations, sales, and engineering, so the Account Specialist must work well with different parts of the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no typical day in a startup, so you will have to be adaptable — there will be no shortage of interesting challenges to tackle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exceptional phone-based and email-based communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to empathize with customers and a passion for delivering a great customer experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent organizational skills and task management abilities&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attention to detail —- no issue slips through the cracks&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Minimum 1 year of work experience (experience working in customer-facing role at a startup is a plus)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Passion for solving big problems and having an immediate and positive impact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Industry or domain experience not required&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Our Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an employee benefits company, benefits are very important to us, and Captain401&amp;#39;s philosophy is to be generous when it comes to employees&amp;#39; wellness. Here&amp;#39;s what we currently offer:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A great 401(k) plan: our own! Our 401(k) includes a dollar-for-dollar employer match up to 4% of compensation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Top-of-the-line health insurance plans, as well as dental and vision insurance, with premiums fully paid for by the company.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An annual membership to One Medical Group, with membership fees paid by Captain401.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Commuter benefits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;FSA with an employer contribution of $250 per year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dollar-for-dollar match of employee donations to non-profit 501(c)(3) organizations, up to $500 per year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Healthy snacks and drinks available at our office.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Team retreats and outings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We try not to spend money on “perks” like ping pong tables. We practice what we preach! We believe employer funds are best spent towards investing in the long-term physical, financial, and emotional well-being of our employees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/capsule.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since 2009 we’ve been making it easy for businesses to take care of their customers and sales opportunities. Capsule is now one of the most popular CRM’s for small businesses and sales teams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re a UK based company with an office in central Manchester. We’re open to remote working if you’re outside of Manchester, but you need to be in the UK for this position. You’ll be joining a small, dedicated &amp;amp;amp; friendly team that cares deeply about the customer experience. We offer a start-up style culture with a competitive salary and benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What we’re looking for:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have experience helping customers through a previous marketing or support-related position and enjoy going the extra mile&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. You will have a positive style and an ability to describe solutions simply&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re able to read between the lines when necessary to minimise emails back-and-forth - helping customers efficiently is key&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You should be self motivated and confident in working independently, but you should also know your limits and when to seek direction&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re a pro at minimising disruptions whether working remotely or in the office and can get through a high volume of well thought out emails each day&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are tech savvy with an interest in web and mobile apps&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous experience using help desk software would be a bonus but not essential&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;A typical week involves:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping existing users get the most out of their Capsule accounts and also highlight the benefits of Capsule to potential users who get in touch via email and Twitter&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Troubleshooting and detailing customer issues for our developers to resolve&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sharing valuable customer feedback with the design and development teams&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Creating and maintaining helpful online support guides&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll also spend some time contributing to scaling and improving our internal support practices&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this excites you and your experience and strengths match what we’re looking for &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:jointheteam@capsulecrm.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;send us an email&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; introducing yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Customer Success Guru (£25-28K, Share Options, Work Remotely) </title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/resource-guru.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 4 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/resource-guru.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resource Guru is a leading cloud-based team calendar and leave management app. It’s the fast, simple way to schedule people, equipment and other resources online. We have customers from over 150 countries around the world including Microsoft, Ogilvy, Deloitte, Yahoo!, AT&amp;amp;amp;T, HBO and the NHS. They all trust Resource Guru to handle one of their most precious assets - their people’s time. Resource Guru was founded in 2011 in London and is backed by one of the world’s leading VCs, Index Ventures. Visit &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://resourceguruapp.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://resourceguruapp.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are a remote team with employees across the UK and South Africa. This means you would be free to work from anywhere with a 4 hour overlap with GMT and a good internet connection. We will be happy to pay for coworking space if you need it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;In Brief&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We like our customers to smile when they think of Resource Guru :) We think of customer service as an opportunity to engage with our customers, and wherever possible convert them into brand advocates. Your main role is to make that happen. As well as supporting existing customers, you’ll be dealing with enquiries from potential customers too. You’ll usually be speaking to people via email, but you’ll also be hosting online demos and will occasionally need to jump on the phone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll help to troubleshoot any technical issues our customers face - whether they’re struggling to change their password, or they’ve reported a bug which needs investigating by our engineers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a separate part of the role, you will carry out QA testing prior to feature releases and, because we’re a small startup, you may also be asked to help out in various other areas too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are looking for a radiator, not a drain. Someone who can empathise with others, is passionate about technology, is level headed and has a pragmatic approach to problem solving.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What You’ll Be Doing&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping to manage the day-to-day customer service for Resource Guru and responding to tickets in a timely manner&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Conducting customer product demos online&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Testing new features and enhancements prior to release&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There’s always lots to do when you work in a startup, so there’ll be plenty of other stuff to get your teeth stuck into!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What We’re Looking For&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An empathetic, conscientious and resourceful person with experience in customer service&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Someone with patience, an upbeat disposition and a good sense of humour who can turn disgruntled customers into happy ones&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A technically inquisitive and knowledgeable person who delights in helping others, can empathise with their issues and think laterally about how to replicate them&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A rigorous troubleshooter who wants to dig deep and get to know our product inside out&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A clear, concise communicator who can keep it light and playful but knows when to be serious&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Someone with excellent English who understands technical jargon&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A positive, autonomous person who is familiar with, and enjoys, remote working&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;These Would Be A Bonus&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience of working in a startup environment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience of working on a SaaS product&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sales experience&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What We’re Offering&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A full time position with a salary of £25-28k&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work from anywhere with at least 4 hrs overlap with GMT&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;25 days paid holiday per year (yes, on top of public holidays!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flexible hours&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly exercise contribution - use it for anything from gym membership to exercise equipment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A small, friendly team - we like to think of ourselves as a family :)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Share options&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Extra day of holiday on your birthday&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If all this rings a bell with you and you’d like to work for one of the UK’s most successful startups, then we would love to hear from you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
