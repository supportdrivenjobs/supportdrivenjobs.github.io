      <title>Omni Phone Support Human</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/omni.html</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/omni.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is expanding our band of Support Humans (also known as our Tech Support team). We’re looking for candidates who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our OS X and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have a surprisingly pleasant conversation about software.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Job Activities&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ll be working with customers who call in or otherwise contact us and need technical help with our Mac and iOS products. If you know the answer to their question, great! If you don’t, gather as much information as you can and work with the other folks here to figure it out so you can get back to them and help.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re looking for candidates who have a positive attitude, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking their way through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t have those binders of troubleshooting scripts some other companies use; your imagination will be one of your most important tools in this job.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You need to enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more once you start working with us.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Compensation and Benefits&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We have great customers that love our apps and push them to their limits. Support Humans get the satisfaction of earning their gratitude by helping them out.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We believe that being friendly is at least as important as being smart when it comes to making great software. When you need help with a problem here, you probably know who to ask and you can assume they’ll be happy to talk about it. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At Omni, we may not always agree on the best way to solve the problems we work on, but we pride ourselves on all being on the same team. This is not a workplace where people can further themselves by tearing you down.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support Humans are explicitly included in the process of creating of our products; they’re a valuable source of insight into the needs and concerns of our customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive total compensation package: base salary in the mid-$40k range, a 401k with matching, and the potential for profit sharing based on company profitability.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fully paid health/dental/vision for you and your dependents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Biweekly massages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Free meals prepared by our Executive Chef and the rest of his team. Your SOs are welcome to eat here or you can pack dinner up to take home to your family. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lots of other good stuff, which you can read about elsewhere on this website.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;How to Get This Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;To be considered for this job, the following things &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;must&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be true:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You live in the Seattle area and are able to work with us in our Seattle office, a little bit north of downtown. We’re not looking for remote employees, and we’re not looking to relocate anyone to fill this position. Apologies in advance, but we won’t be making any exceptions on this.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are empathetic, patient, and have a positive attitude, even when helping a customer who is having a very bad day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have strong problem-solving, communication, and customer service skills. You can think your way through problems and enjoy helping our customers solve them. (Even if the problems aren’t well-defined, even if the usual solutions aren’t working, and even if it’s the fifth person you’ve helped solve that problem today.) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You also have the ability to speak up, ask questions, and absorb technical information. You’ll be well supported while you’re learning about our applications, but you need to be the kind of person that asks for help when they need it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You are comfortable using and solving problems with Macs, iOS devices, and the apps that run on them. If you’re the person that your relatives ask for help with their Apple Store purchases, that’s a good sign.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you’re not actually an animal person, you should be able to tolerate them in the workplace. Employees bring their dogs to the office on a daily basis.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Special Bonus Lightning Round Extras&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The following things aren’t requirements, but would be nice to mention if they apply to you:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Previous phone-based tech support experience would be a big plus. General phone-based customer service experience or in-person tech support experience would also be plusses.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience using Terminal commands and/or the ability to comfortably hand-edit XML, HTML, or JavaScript would be another huge plus. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Read or speak a language other than English? We’re listening. :-)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ideal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; candidate would have some experience with our applications. If you haven’t ever used them, go to our website and read about them. If they seem interesting to you, this is a good sign. If you have access to a Mac, download them and play with them. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To apply, send an email to&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:resumes@omnigroup.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;resumes@omnigroup.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; include the exact phrase “Phone Support Human” in the subject line. Include a copy of your résumé in text, HTML, RTF or PDF form.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; if you send your resume as a Word document, you will not be considered for the position. No phone calls or visits to the office, please.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every applicant that sends in a resume before &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;February 22nd&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; will receive a set of sample support questions to work on; applicants will have until &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;February 28th&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to submit responses. Those answers are by far the most important factor we’ll use when selecting applicants to invite in for interviews.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our goal with this hire is to find coworkers that will impress our customers by solving problems better and faster than they expect, that will suggest ways to improve our products so a problem that occurred today is solved tomorrow, and who we’ll enjoy working alongside in this important, meaningful, and deeply silly industry we’ve chosen to devote our careers to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Omni&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Omni Group is a rewarding but nontraditional place to work, and our compensation packages reflect that. We offer the usual range of traditional benefits to employees:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Competitive salaries, based on experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonuses, based on our revenues and profitability for the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock options. (Note that we are not aiming to become publicly traded.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;401(k), with some company matching, again depending on our revenues and profitability for the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full health coverage.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vision and dental coverage.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when we founded this business we knew that we were going to spend a ton of time here, so basic survival dictated that it should be fun as well as easy to work in. To those ends, we also have some less traditional benefits:&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Omni has a professional chef and assistants with the power of a restaurant-grade kitchen at their disposal. Dinner is at five o’clock every weeknight; your SO and kids are welcome, too. If you find eating at the office to be impractical, feel free to pack some food up to take home with you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Personal hardware purchase budget. Omni provides everything you need to get your job done in the office, but if you need an extra 30” display at home we can help with that too.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Professional development budget, which covers conferences, training, or materials that you can convince us will help further your work-related skills.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Corporate matching of personal contributions to 501(c) non-profits, up to a limit.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A theater, and other media amenities. Miss a WWDC session? Watch it on our hugenormous projector. Fail to watch indie movies when they first came out? Check them out from our movie library!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A whole mess of console video game systems, both current and old-school. There is a dedicated A/V system for the games, so someone can watch Game of Thrones while others play Rock Band. And of course, we have a large suite of board games, D&amp;amp;amp;D goodies, pinball, and other classic paraphernalia.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;On-site massages.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, don’t get the impression we just goof around: it takes a lot of hard work to make our products a joy for our customers. Doing what we do, and doing it the way we choose to, is not easy. Luckily, we all love doing what we do, and we hope you will too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Omni is located in rainy Seattle, possibly the most beautiful city in North America. The air here is still clean, the people still friendly, local brands are still more popular than national brands, and music festivals still feel like they are for the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Appointlet Customer Success Manager</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/appointlet.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/appointlet.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Appointlet is a Portland, OR based SaaS startup that is making life easier for sales teams by eliminating the back-and-forth of scheduling calls and video conferences with customers &amp;amp;amp; prospects. If you&amp;#39;ve ever seen a &amp;quot;Schedule Demo&amp;quot; button on a website or in emails, we want to be that button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We provide our customers with a widget that let’s their prospects easily book a time to be given a product or service demo. After the visitor books a time, it’s added to the company’s calendar so they can focus on selling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our software is small, but the impact it has on our customers is huge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who this is for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This position is for someone that…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Has excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is extremely patient and nice, even when the customer isn’t.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Knows (generally) how the SaaS industry works.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loves solving problems. Every customer is different so being able to meet their specific needs and go above and beyond to provide them with additional value is a must.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Doesn’t want to work for a corporate machine. There are two of us, so you’ll be the third.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is self-motivated and able to stay productive without supervision.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wants reasonably flexible hours and a laid back work environment.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you&amp;#39;ll do:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Be on the front-line replying to customers in Intercom.io and on the phone.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Explain the benefits of Appointlet to visitors and help on-board them when they sign up.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintaining our knowledge base by adding/updating guides and frequently asked questions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Researching and implementing techniques to improve customer retention.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Forming relationships with our bigger customers and checking in on them.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experiment: this is a startup so you’ll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Vend Customer Insights Analyst</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/vend.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/vend.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just in case this is the first time you’ve visited our website, Vend is an award winning, web based, point of sale software for retail. We’re chucking out crusty old cash registers and replacing them with iPads, touch screens and beautiful software, all of this to make life easier for our retailers. Vend is a fast-growing tech start-up, since launching in 2010 we’ve now got 10,000+ customers all over the world with more than 170 employees shared between our Auckland, Melbourne, Toronto, London &amp;amp;amp; San Francisco offices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our cloud-based retail point of sale platform is replacing crusty old cash registers and giving our retailers the tools they need to grow their businesses. We’re shaking things up and pushing out innovations, creating huge demand for our SaaS solution all over the world. With strategic relationships with the likes of Apple and Xero, we’re footing it with the big guys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This role is part of our Customer Success team which works with 1000s of customers over 1000s of interactions daily. You will analyse all these interactions and turn that data into clear, concise, and actionable insights, allowing us to do two things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create new initiatives that will improve the customer experience.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Enable our customer support teams to improve the way they interact with customers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re looking for an analyst with data or business intelligence skills that can work specifically with our customer support team, while collaborating with our business intelligence and strategy teams as well!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;WHAT WILL YOU BE WORKING ON? WELL, YOU&amp;#39;LL BE...&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working closely with our customer support team on things like ad hoc data requests, dashboards, reports, alerts and real time performance metrics, that will help support our strategy and business metrics (the terms SLAs, volume coverage and productivity really get you excited).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborating with our business intelligence team, doing things like identifying opportunities for improved data efficiency in customer success.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Generally collecting and analysing high quality data, providing us with actionable information for our customer support (and non-customer support) teams.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developing new insights to help us make the best decisions and develop new customer success initiatives, improving processes and enabling innovation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Using data to help drive up our key customer success metrics (like NPS and customer health scores!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;DOES THIS SOUND LIKE YOU?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’re accurate, with an eye for detail.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ve got analytical horsepower with experience in customer analytics, business intelligence, data mining and/or research analytics building decision making models.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ve got ideally one year of experience working with data analytics or data insights in some capacity, dealing with and analysing high volumes of data.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You can tell a meaningful story from quantitative and qualitative analysis and you can transform data sets into actionable insights for people who aren’t as data savvy as you!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You’ve got a Bachelor’s degree in a number heavy topic, or relevant work experience. You’re a whizz with numbers!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You love digging into large data sets using MS Excel, DB querying, pivot tables, macros &amp;amp;amp; BI tools.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ideally, you’ll also have experience working with customers in or with customer support teams.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What can you expect from us? Well, we could tell you. But a better way is to show you! Check out #weworkatvend on Instagram for some snaps of what we get up to here. Get in touch, apply now - an opportunity like this rarely comes up so we&amp;#39;d hate for you to miss out :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Perform with grace under pressure and maintain composure and friendliness even when dealing with frustrated or impatient users.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help document product features and create video tutorials aimed at existing and new customers to evangelize products.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work independently with minimal daily oversight, while also contributing to and collaborating with a close-knit team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;College degree or equivalent experience in a related field&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2-3 years in a customer support role&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Self-starting, highly motivated&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A naturally gracious and patient – but thick-skinned – demeanor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent writing and interpersonal skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Software development experience, with a proven ability to understand the tech side (even if you’re not a developer)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Familiarity with the Nathalie Lussier brand and - AmbitionAlly products (being a customer/user is a major plus!)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;AmbitionAlly is a tight-knit company with remote team members across the US, Canada, and abroad and it’s growing quickly, which means that a fast pace and constant communication is key.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Give me two examples of how you helped someone with a difficult problem – one where the interaction was totally positive, and one where there was some conflict (and how you resolved it).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell me what great movies you’ve seen recently, and why you liked them.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attach, or include in the body of the email: your resume, salary requirements, and a link to your website (if applicable).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell me why – very specifically – you want to work for me. What do you think I can offer you (besides a paycheck)?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re ready to work with me to take this business off the charts even more, send your cover letter and resume to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#104;i&amp;amp;#114;&amp;amp;#x69;&amp;amp;#x6e;&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#x61;&amp;amp;#x74;h&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#x6c;&amp;amp;#105;e&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#117;&amp;amp;#115;s&amp;amp;#105;e&amp;amp;#x72;&amp;amp;#46;&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#104;i&amp;amp;#114;&amp;amp;#x69;&amp;amp;#x6e;&amp;amp;#x67;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#110;&amp;amp;#x61;&amp;amp;#x74;h&amp;amp;#97;&amp;amp;#x6c;&amp;amp;#105;e&amp;amp;#108;&amp;amp;#117;&amp;amp;#115;s&amp;amp;#105;e&amp;amp;#x72;&amp;amp;#46;&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (put “Customer Success Specialist” in the subject line).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Who we are:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Songkick is the largest concert discovery service and artist-to-fan ticketing platform in the world. Our goal is to help artists sell more tickets directly to their fans and fix the central problem at the heart of the concert industry – that 50% of tickets go unsold. Working with over 500 artists and ticketing thousands of events worldwide each year, we’re working to make every show a sellout.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Songkick delivers personalized alerts for upcoming concerts to its 10 million monthly unique fans, making it easy for these fans to track their favorite artists so they never miss them live.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our company has also powered worldwide programs for some of the world’s biggest artists, including Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire, Imagine Dragons, Blake Shelton, and Paul McCartney, creating the ultimate artist experience by linking fans through innovative ticketing technology and marketing solutions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With offices strategically positioned in London, Los Angeles, Nashville, and New York, Songkick combines technology and expertise to make the concert experience better for artists and fans alike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What we’re looking for:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have an opening for an ambitious Graduate to join us at Songkick’s New York or LA offices.

      <title>Zapier Customer Champion</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/zapier.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/zapier.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;#39;re looking for someone who loves helping people. If you love interacting with people on a daily basis to help them learn how to optimize their work then read on&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re empathetic to users and can easily put yourself in their shoes. You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered after interacting with support and not stupid because of a small mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You obsess over the details. Maybe you have a one emoticon and one exclamation point rule of thumb for every email. Maybe it&amp;#39;s only two sentences per paragraph. Either way, you make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes the customer delighted to work with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love solving problems. Every customer is different, many times radically so. You relish being able to meet their specific need, and also solving their problems that may have gone unsaid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to write. Almost everything at Zapier is done via written communication (both with customers and between teammates).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re persistent. Support at Zapier is much different than at many software companies. It&amp;#39;s not the same questions over and over again, and often involves researching technical nuances of the apps we support. You love the opportunity to solve new problems every day and won&amp;#39;t give up when you don&amp;#39;t know the answer right away.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love to set your own course. At Zapier, we have quick team meetings each week and one-on-one meetings every month and then we go make things happen. You get to make things happen without someone saying so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Things You Might Do&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zapier is a startup, so you&amp;#39;ll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you&amp;#39;ll get to lead:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write documentation to help users help themselves (all the documentation on our help site is written and maintained by the support team: https://zapier.com/help/)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work with the product team to build tools that will speed up and increase the quality of support at the same time&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About Zapier&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the past three years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;The Whole Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Location: Anywhere you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to work remote, that&amp;#39;s cool. If you want to work near others, that&amp;#39;s cool too. The current support team is in Washington, Virginia, Florida, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Texas, Australia, and Spain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compensation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;How to Apply&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applying is simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send an email to supportjobs@zapier.com&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us about yourself&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tell us why you want to work at Zapier vs. somewhere else.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then answer these 6 questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What should our goal be when replying to users?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A user requests an integration with a service that we don&amp;#39;t support yet. How would you word your response?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set up a zap that takes new Gmail emails from a specific sender and adds them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.  Send us the link to the zap and a share link for the spreadsheet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Send us a link to an app&amp;#39;s API docs that you think are well done, and explain why you think they are good.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Look at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gist.github.com/WadeFoster/0bd294efe54f8fb8a1e7&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this list&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and pick the 5 things that most excite you. Also pick the 5 things that least excite you. Don&amp;#39;t pick by your opinion of importance, this is mostly to see interest/experience. Please put this answer somewhere like &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gist.github.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Gists&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://pastebin.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Pastebin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and include a link in your email.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about Zapier?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;All teammates at Zapier also agree to a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;code of conduct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that keeps Zapier a safe, welcoming and inclusive environment.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
