      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You...&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Are good at seeing things from other people&amp;#39;s point of view&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strive to take care of others like you would take care of your own family&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Love to build relationships with customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Want to take customer care to the next level&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Emulate other companies that provide amazing service: Disney, Chick-Fil-A, Nordstrom, Ritz-Carlton, Trader Joe&amp;#39;s, and Zappos are some great examples&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See the value in having a rabid, loyal customer base&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Embrace change&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Push for excellence&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What you&amp;#39;ll be doing&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Delighting our customers by forming real relationships with them (through phone, email, and chat), including sending out postcards and follow-up emails to show our appreciation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Forming meaningful relationships with company administrators (Nike, Buffalo Wild Wings, Bed Bath &amp;amp;amp; Beyond, Goodwill, and Jazzercise are just a few companies that use us) while assisting them with setup, onboarding, and follow-up&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Providing insightful advice and friendly support to ProTrainings customers in need&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Quickly diagnosing problems on the spot, determining and explaining situations with patience and empathy so they can get trained and get back to work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Taking ownership of every customer interaction — we empower you to make decisions and care for customers in creative ways — no robots here&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborating with other departments to WOW our customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learning and growing professionally by taking time every week to read articles or books from our bookshelf to better yourself&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We are open to remote workers who have a great work ethic, are self-motivated, and do great work without direct supervision&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Availability&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our goal is to create a schedule that you’ll love. We’re currently in need of additional weeknight (5pm-8pm EST) and weekend (12pm-8pm) Happiness Hero coverage. These shifts could be filled in a number of ways, from joining either part or full-time (or something in-between). We’re truly open and flexible to creating a win-win solution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Desired experience&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have worked in a customer-relations role in the past, whether that was as a receptionist, a call center rep, nursing assistant, barista, bank teller, anything in retail, or any other position in which you helped and delighted customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Basic skills we&amp;#39;re looking for&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong writing skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong people skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A good speaking voice&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to maintain composure and customer focus while troubleshooting and solving technical issues&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comfortable with technology&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fast typer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comfortable on phone, email, and chat&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fast learner&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attention to detail&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus if you are able to speak Spanish (at least at a high school level) and interested in learning more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Benefits you&amp;#39;ll love&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fun culture / atmosphere&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A career that makes a difference (train people to save lives, hear heroic stories, and receive awesome testimonials from really grateful customers)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High level of autonomy and creativity while helping and delighting customers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Extensive, continuous training (you won&amp;#39;t be thrown in blind)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Professional development library (request a book or resource, and you&amp;#39;ll have it within 2 weeks)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CPR / first aid training &amp;amp;amp; certification&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Full-time employees are also eligible for:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Health / dental insurance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Paid time off&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- 401k with company match&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Ready to help save lives?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;#39;re still reading this, we would love to learn more about you. Shoot an email to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:careers@protrainings.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;careers at protrainings.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and include the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A fun, catchy subject line&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your top 3 strengths&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A time that you went above and beyond to help someone (preferably in a work setting, but a personal interaction is fine)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your ideal schedule (full or part time, which days/hours)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Why you want to work at ProTrainings&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your résumé&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

      <title>Expensify Success Coach</title>
      <link>http://jobs.supportdriven.com/jobs/expensify-london.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/expensify-london.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expensify prides itself on solving real-world problems with a team of top-notch product experts. We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About The Job&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About You&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love developing relationships with others and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital maven and love interacting with customers through email, in-product, and sometimes over the phone. Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who can:&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Maintain customer relationships and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written (and verbal) communication.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we&amp;#39;re all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who&amp;#39;s able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be sometimes repetitive and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is squarely grounded in support, no matter the customer size.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Next Steps&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you&amp;#39;re awesome, it&amp;#39;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we&amp;#39;re going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don&amp;#39;t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren&amp;#39;t successful addressing their concerns, why not?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#106;o&amp;amp;#98;&amp;amp;#x73;&amp;amp;#x40;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#112;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x6e;s&amp;amp;#105;&amp;amp;#x66;&amp;amp;#121;.&amp;amp;#99;&amp;amp;#111;&amp;amp;#109;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We&amp;#39;re excited to hear from you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">jobs/automattic.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a Happiness Engineer, helping people is your passion. Maybe you’ve developed your own support philosophy by reading books like Delivering Happiness or Exceptional Service, Exceptional Profit. Perhaps you’re a contributor in an online support community such as the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transforming publishing on the web is no small task. Our goal is to build relationships based on trust which result in happy, passionate, loyal customers and colleagues. We do this through listening to their needs and guiding them to the fullest use of the products we offer. We are looking for people with the right mix of compassion, writing skills, and technical knowledge to get the job done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;In general, a typical day involves:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Helping people use Automattic’s products, including &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Gravatar, and more&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Troubleshooting, investigating, and creating detailed bug reports&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Crafting and editing helpful support documentation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Being an active member of a team that provides around the clock support to our users via live chat, forums, and email&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Building a community of support by sharing knowledge and insight amongst team members&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Being a Happiness Engineer requires:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Patience, grace, and a sense of humor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Excellent writing and communication skills&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Working knowledge of WordPress, HTML, and CSS&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A knack for taking technical language and making it understandable&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A passion for solving tough problems and proposing elegant solutions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happiness Engineers must be fluent and eloquent in written English. If you know additional languages, be sure to tell us!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wordpress.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WordPress.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; forums are fantastic places to gain the experience required for this position.
