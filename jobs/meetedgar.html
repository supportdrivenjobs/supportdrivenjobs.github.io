        <div><p>Full-time remote position, 40 hours/week<br/>Like a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence, our marketing team is dedicated to helping people discover something new and exciting - and in our case, that means leading them to Edgar. But what about all those people out there who could use a little extra push? Well, That’s where you come in, dear reader - we’re looking for a User Outreach Specialist who can lead the charge on identifying and nurturing leads, leading product demos, and whatever else our pre-customers might need!</p><h3>About You</h3><p>You’re a take-charge sort of guy/gal/non-binary individual - somebody who can tell when a person needs a nudge or three in the right direction, and proactively gives them the information they need to make their own brilliant decisions. You’re not a salesperson - you’re a matchmaker, setting people up with bliss-inducing solutions to their most problem-y problems.<br/>In this position, that means working with our marketing team to do things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify and nurture leads via email, social media, and more</li>
  <li>Conduct personalized one-on-one demos as needed</li>
  <li>Respond to emails and online chats from our leads</li>
  <li>Transition new customers into our onboarding process</li>
</ul><p>Sometimes, the people who’ll benefit most from your help and expertise will come to you - other times, you’ll seek them out yourself. That means you’re someone who understands the weird lil’ intersection of social media, SaaS products, and content marketing where Edgar lives, and the issues that are important to anyone else in that neighborhood. </p><p>How can you tell when what we offer is what someone’s looking for? How do you communicate that - and how does your strategy change from person to person? What matters most to one type of lead versus another, and how do you help them meet their needs? These are the types of questions you’ll be answering in this position - so be ready! (Sorry, we totally didn’t give you a spoiler alert beforehand.)</p><p>Because this role requires significant interaction with potential customers, you’ll work alongside both our Marketing and Customer Experience teams to make our relationships with our leads better than ever. From conducting proactive outreach to responding to the needs of prospective users, your day-to-day will be the types of one-on-one interactions that a people person’s dreams are made of!</p><h3>Job Deets Cheat Sheet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is a full-time, salaried remote position - you must live somewhere in North America and be able to show eligibility to work in the USA</li>
  <li>Sales/marketing experience a plus</li>
  <li>Customer service experience also preferred, ideally with technology-related products/services</li>
  <li>An extrovert’s love of reaching out to new people (an introvert’s love of staying at home is okay, though)</li>
  <li>Able to read a situation and determine someone’s needs - even if they don’t spell them out for you</li>
  <li>Confident hosting live demos, Q&amp;A sessions, and sing-a-longs</li>
  <li>Demonstrably good judgment</li>
</ul><h3>About Us</h3><p>We’re a small team of 18-ish people, all working remotely across the US &amp; Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual retreat week where we work together on cool projects all day and rock the karaoke mic all night. (Spoiler alert: This means you have to be willing and able to travel to those retreats! The karaoke, however, is optional.)<br/>We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks. </p><p>We'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)</p><p>You can find out more at <a href="http://meetedgar.com/careers/">http://meetedgar.com/careers/</a> and by watching this video (please watch it, it was mad expensive):<br/><iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvU3P43b0rQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3>Perks &amp; Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)</li>
  <li>4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam! And yes, everyone actually uses all 4 weeks)</li>
  <li>Monthly cleaning service for your home - not that we don't have total faith in you</li>
  <li>Paid home Internet service</li>
  <li>Coworking space/coffee shop working expenses</li>
  <li>Coverage for health, dental, and vision for you and your fam</li>
  <li>401(k) with matching</li>
  <li>An extra paid day off per quarter so you can volunteer in your community (awww)</li>
  <li>New Mac laptop (#blessed)</li>
  <li>Books, conferences, and other educational resources to help you be even more amazing at what you do!</li>

We don’t bother with office politics, both because that’s way too cliche, and also, because we don’t have an office. (So, you can wear stretchy pants to work and no one will judge.)</p><p>We know we’re ridiculously lucky to have this group of ambitious, kind, independent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing in even more people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they’ll be super proud of.</p><p><a href="https://meetedgar.com/careers/">Careers at MeetEdgar</a></p></div>
