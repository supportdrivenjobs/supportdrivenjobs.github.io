            <strong>Culture</strong>
            <div><p>We are a young team of friendly people, who care a lot about what we do. Our company provides great benefits that cover health, vision and dental insurance, lunch, and public transit, and include a sweet 401k and above-market equity. We are fueled by great coffee, afternoon cookies and Super Stickman Golf (if you haven't played it, give it a try -- the multiplayer is amazing).</p><p><b>How We Work:</b><br/>We take pride in the fact that each employee makes decisions for themselves. At meetings, we talk openly and directly and we collaborate across disciplines. Our engineering and design teams work closely together and iterate quickly, while relying on marketing, customer experience, and QA to be the voice of the customer in team discussions.</p><p><b>When and Where:</b><br/>Our team keeps work and life well-balanced. Each person's schedule is defined by how excited they are to solve a problem and we trust everyone to get things done. We take vacations when the time is right. We work from home when it will help.</p><p>The open-plan office space where Notability comes to life is in downtown SF. We have height-adjustable desks to help us stay limber as well as a shuffleboard and an arcade basketball machine to help us stay coordinated. We are looking to build our team in our San Francisco office.</p></div>
