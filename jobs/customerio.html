            <p>Got questions about Customer.io?<br/>@hoon can answer them in the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/support-driven-chat/">Support Driven Chat</a></p>
        </div>

        <div><div id="content" class="">
      <p>Do you love to help people solve problems? Are you curious about how things work? Do you find yourself always asking, <em>what can I do to help</em>?</p>
<p>If so, you may be who we’re looking for! <strong>Customer.io is seeking the fourth member of our Technical Support team.</strong></p>
<p>At Customer.io, our mission is helping businesses talk like people. Today, we do this with messaging software allowing businesses with large user-bases (500,000+ users) to send targeted, more relevant communication at scale. Our customers include Shutterstock, DigitalOcean, Handy, Watsi, plus over 800 other internet businesses.</p>
<h2><strong>What You'll Be Doing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Every day, you’ll answer customer requests and questions, mostly over email. This could vary between very complex questions like “how do I set up this complicated drip campaign with Customer.io?” to processing tasks like “please import some data for my users” and plenty of things in between.</li>
<li>Occasionally, you’ll call existing customers to walk them through tasks and answer questions about the software. Email is #1 here, but we’ll pick up the phone when needed.</li>
<li>You’ll write new or update existing documentation (both internal and external) with words, images, and screencasts.</li>
<li>You’ll be recording feature requests, tracking them internally, and explaining these to our Product and Engineering teams directly.</li>
<li>You’ll dedicatedly look for ways to improve the software or our service.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a small team at a startup, you’ll likely get the opportunity to do a lot of different things—including projects and tasks we don’t even know we need to do yet!</p>
<h2>About You</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have amazing written and verbal communication skills. Besides talking with customers all the time, our team is located in Germany, Texas, and Oregon, and being able to communicate effectively in this remote environment is paramount.</li>
<li>You exhibit our <a href="https://customer.io/careers/">Core Values: <strong>Empathy, Transparency, and Responsibility</strong></a>. These values guide us when we talk with customers.</li>
<li>You’re independent and self-motivated. While previous remote experience is not necessary, being remote from your entire team can be a challenging experience for anyone who hasn’t done it before. These qualities are essential to be successful on our team.</li>
<li>You’re curious and enjoy learning new things through investigation. Our team tracks down root cause of an issue, be it a bug, something confusing in our software, etc.</li>
<li>You don’t like to leave questions unanswered. If you don’t understand something you’ll dig until you find the answer.</li>
<li>You’re passionate about technology (in the web and mobile spaces). Familiarity with things like HTML and CSS (for email marketing), Liquid markup, JavaScript, and APIs is a big asset.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why you should work with us</h2>
<p>Work anywhere in the world you want. We'll buy you what you need to deck out your home office or give you a monthly budget for some coworking space. We want you to work where you'll be most productive.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive salary</strong> - We’re offering $55,000 for this role.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong> - You'll own a piece of the company. It's not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we're planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it will be a nice bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Big Impact</strong> - Our team is small but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company.</p>
<p><strong>Great Tools</strong> - Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, a motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you need to get your job done.</p>
<p><strong>Health Benefits</strong> - We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental, and vision insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Retreats</strong> - The whole company gets together twice a year: once at HQ in Portland, OR and once a year we travel. We’ve visited places like Barcelona, Spain; Sinaia, Romania; and Hunter Mountain, NY.</p>
<p><strong>Vacation</strong> - Rest and recuperation are important. We offer unlimited paid time off with a two-week minimum per year.</p>
