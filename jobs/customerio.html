            <p>Got questions about Customer.io?<br/>@rachelroyall can answer them in the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/support-driven-chat/">Support Driven Chat</a></p>
        </div>

        <div><p>Hello, future addition to Customer.io! We’re looking forward to getting to know you better, but you probably want to know what you’re getting yourself into. You can check out our careers page, or read on.</p><p>At Customer.io, our mission is helping businesses talk like people. Today, we do this with messaging software that allows businesses with large user-bases to send targeted, more relevant communication at scale.</p><h3>A day in the life of a Deliverability Specialist</h3><p>A Deliverability Specialist at Customer.io helps new and existing customers get up and running in our product, diagnose tricky situations related to email deliverability, and achieve their business goals. Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) and a Deliverability Specialist on our Technical Support Team has contact with more customers than anyone else in the company.</p><h3>What skills will you bring to the table?</h3><p>First and foremost, we’re looking for someone with experience diagnosing and solving email deliverability issues. We’re also looking for some customer support experience, responding mainly via email within a remote/async environment. Ideally you’ve worked with or supported email marketing/business communication tools, too. You should be comfortable with basic programming concepts (API, variables, if-else statements, loops, etc.). You’re willing to work in US Eastern hours on a regular basis.</p><h3>Your contributions to the team will include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>being the expert on the team for any deliverability questions or problems our customers may have</li>
  <li>identifying ways deliverability rates can be higher including working with partner sites and services to mitigate the risk of any future blacklisting.</li>
  <li>establishing tools that can monitor the list of our IP addresses to proactively head off any blacklist issues.</li>
  <li>building processes and procedures to ensure the entire team can work seamlessly to help our customers when deliverability issues arise.</li>
</ul><p>Beyond your focus on deliverability, you’ll develop deep product, systems and customer knowledge by supporting our customers via email. You’ll also work on internal and external documentation and have regular touch points with our Product and Development teams to discuss feature requests, usability issues and user scenarios. You’ll bring your passion for customers and their problems to advocate for product improvements and provide insight that will help us make sure we build the right thing.</p><p>In the long run there are opportunities to apply that to automate processes and create internal tools or to join our Customer Success team which helps our high revenue customers make the most of our product. We have many new features to build and ideas to implement, so there will be plenty of exciting challenges ahead.</p><p>Today the Technical Support team is powered by Help Scout for tickets, Github Issues for bug tracking and Zapier to help automate some of our support processes.</p><p>Although, we mostly interact with each other through Basecamp and Slack and value focused work, we’re not afraid to jump on a Screenhero pairing session or a video call to clarify customer scenarios or share tips on how to troubleshoot issues better.</p><h3>You’ll be joining a team of 4 including:</h3><p><b>Wendy Teo</b> - Director of Technical Support - lovingly referred to as unicorn because she’s fantastic AND elusive (we rarely get to see her whole face)</p><p>And our Technical Support Engineers:<br/><br/><b>Brandi Young</b> - resident Texan, considers eminem her guilty pleasure and is perfectly introverted and awkward.</p><p><b>Wiley Jenkins</b> - from coffee stand to tech, and most recently, Customer.io; Wiley will make you smile.</p><p><b>Dan Schales</b> - Star Wars expert, enjoying family life in Washington State; Dan’s the support(man).</p><p>The folks above are an incredible group, and we’re excited for you to meet them. If you’re still reading this, then you’ll share some qualities with them like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You love technical problem solving</li>
  <li>You enjoy helping others with your technical knowledge and take pride in your work.</li>
  <li>You see every support ticket as an opportunity to improve the customer experience.</li>
  <li>You take ownership of delivering results and get satisfaction from getting things done.</li>
  <li>You’re passionate about learning new things.</li>
  <li>You’re not afraid to ask questions if you’re confused about how something works.</li>
  <li>You understand written communication is not always perfect and assume the best intentions during interactions with customers and your team. Empathy is one of your strongest attributes.</li>
</ul><h3>Why should you work with Customer.io?</h3><p>We want to enable you to do your best work, and this is how we aim to do that—</p><p><b>Salary:</b> We’re offering $70,000 USD for this position in the company.</p><p><b>Equity:</b> You’ll own a piece of the company. It's not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we're planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it may be a nice bonus.</p><p><b>Big impact:</b> Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company, both with our product and our culture.</p><p><b>Great tools:</b> Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you'd like to get your job done.</p><p><b>Health benefits:</b> We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental and vision.</p><p><b>Paid Parental &amp; Medical Leave</b> - including adoption</p><p><b>Retreats:</b> We want everyone in our company to connect in person whenever possible, so we get everyone together once a year. We've had retreats in Barcelona, Romania, and Hunter Mountain, NY. We’re going to Iceland in September!</p><p><b>Vacation:</b> Rest and recuperation are important. We offer unlimited paid time off with a two week minimum per year.</p><h3>Diversity at Customer.io</h3><p>At Customer.io, we’re committed to building a diverse environment, and encourage minority applicants. So far, we have team members in Scotland, Germany, Canada, and all over the US. Our CEO and CTO grew up in Singapore and Arkansas respectively, but met in New York City. Our company culture is always evolving; people from different backgrounds bring valued perspective and thoughtfulness to the work that we do and the culture we foster.</p><p>Customer.io provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.
