        <div><p>At Life.Church we believe our jobs are a calling. We are risk-taking, irrationally generous, spiritual contributors who bring our best, laugh hard, and honor God with integrity. We are mutually broken and trying, together, to find restoration in Christ and to help restore our community and the world. Our life and our work are centered around one thing: leading people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. </p><p>With more than 240 million installs of the Bible App and 12 million installs of the Bible App for Kids, the YouVersion team continues to grow and evolve in an effort to appropriately steward the opportunities brought our way. We are looking for a driven and capable leader for user support of the Bible App, the Bible App for Kids, and our website, www.bible.com. Do you have the ability to lead, motivate, and grow an international support team, a passion for critical analysis and problem-solving, and the ability to drive change? If you do, you should definitely keep reading.</p><h3>We want someone who will:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a large global team consisting of hundreds of international volunteers</li>
  <li>Supply original ideas and create efficient processes</li>
  <li>Work autonomously and drive change through influence</li>
  <li>Keep up with new tools and processes in the world of user support and think critically about how we could apply them</li>
</ul><h3>You want a job that includes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Helping millions of users around the world better engage in the Bible</li>
  <li>Leading, growing, and inspiring an international team that includes dozens of different cultures and backgrounds</li>
