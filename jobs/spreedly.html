        <div><p>Spreedly is a fast-growing startup that is building out a support team to keep up with our expanding customer growth. We need an experienced technical support person that can jump into the role, start learning, and contribute quickly.</p><p>We're a payments API that’s used by developers around the world. This makes the technical aspect of a support team member very important, so we are looking for someone who can code. Today our engineering team primarily works with Ruby, Rails, Riak, Postgres, Redis, and Linux; tomorrow could see them using Elixir, Rust, Kafka, FreeBSD, etc. We need someone with grit enough to dive into code to troubleshoot customer problems, but who can also express empathy and patience in moments of confusion.</p><p>You’ll be spending the majority of your time answering customer inquiries and researching issues, as well as consistently updating and maintaining documentation and other customer-facing materials to make our customers’ experience with Spreedly as simple as possible.</p><h3>RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Work with customers and find resolutions to their questions as quickly and simply as possible.</li>
  <li>Speak to customers daily with an engaging personality, polished written/verbal communication skills, and meticulous attention to detail.</li>
  <li>Support Spreedly’s self-service goals by guiding prospects and customers to use the rich, publicly available resources to best serve their initial and ongoing use of the service.</li>
  <li>Discover and analyze gaps in customer experience and identify early warning signals that lead to churn - and then work with other teams to address root causes.</li>
  <li>Build compelling business cases backed by data to introduce new processes or functions that will drive customer success at scale.</li>
</ul><h3>QUALIFICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Proven experience working with technical customers/end users, who are primarily developers using our API to support commerce businesses, including heavy usage of curl, Git, etc.</li>
  <li>The confidence and ability to embrace new technologies, as needed, to advance Spreedly’s ever changing support goals.</li>
  <li>Ability to operate semi-autonomously to incorporate your own immediate priorities with the longer-term and ever-shifting needs of a startup environment.</li>
  <li>Consultative and investigative mindset with the ability to find the right pieces of information to put together the whole puzzle.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated ability to work remotely with desire to work Pacific time zone hours; i.e. UTC-7.</li>
  <li>Our team is largely based in the RDU area of North Carolina, however we are looking for someone remote for this opportunity who will ideally be located on the West coast of the U.S.</li>
</ul><p>The team needs people that are great at their job who know how to elevate the team members and customers around them. You must enjoy talking to customers every day, but always be looking for new ways to automate yourself out of the job. Your contributions will be formative in helping to build the support org from the ground up. This opportunity is perfect for someone with an unmatched passion for understanding customers’ needs and connecting the dots to make them continuously successful with our service.</p></div>
