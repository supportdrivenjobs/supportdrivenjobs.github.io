            <strong>Culture</strong>
            <div><p>We believe live music can change your life. We believe there’s no better way to experience music than to see your favorite artist live. It’s an experience that can’t be reproduced, and it’s a lasting memory you share only with those who were there. We want everyone to have this experience.</p>           <p>In the office, we like to keep it casual while knowing when to put that professional step forward. We work hard because we know that playing hard will always follow. We like people who aren’t afraid to take risks, make mistakes, or vigorously disagree. Our culture is one of our most valued assets, and as we grow, we strive to maintain that small start-up feel.</p>           <p>Read more about our culture and check out our 'Life at Songkick' video over on our Jobs page: <a href="http://blog.songkick.com/jobs">http://blog.songkick.com/jobs</a></p></div>
