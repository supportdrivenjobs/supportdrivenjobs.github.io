<div class="row">
    <div class="post large-8 columns">
        

        

        <div><p>As a Product Advocate, you’ll use technical experience, product knowledge, and sales skills to help every customer get the most value from SolarWinds’ Monitoring Cloud (SaaS) products:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Librato (infrastructure monitoring): <a href="https://www.librato.com/">https://www.librato.com/</a></li>
  <li>Papertrail (log-centric troubleshooting): <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">https://papertrailapp.com/</a></li>
  <li>Pingdom (Web performance): <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">https://www.pingdom.com/</a></li>
  <li>TraceView (application performance monitoring) : <a href="https://traceview.solarwinds.com/">https://traceview.solarwinds.com/</a></li>
</ul><p>If you’ve made a restaurant reservation, collaborated in a text chat room, or purchased a plane ticket, you probably used a service which depends on SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud.</p><h3>Why is this role important?</h3><p>Your customers, many of whom are fellow engineers, will come to see you as a trusted peer. You’ll be instrumental in figuring out what types of technical account management actually help, why, and how to scale it. This is an incredibly fast-growing market. As the SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud thrives and expands in the coming years, you’ll have contributed significantly to that growth.</p><h3>Why is this position unique?</h3><p>Big company benefits and customer base, startup flexibility. As Product Advocate, you’ll:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be the primary contact for your customers, not just a sales engineer. If you’re equally adept at cloning a git repo as you are at explaining why a product is valuable enough to pay for, this role is for you.<br/>have an unusual amount of control over which actions may be worth your time. We’ll be brainstorming, selecting, and testing these together.</li>
  <li>see the impact of your work every day – not in 0.1% of customers, but in 10% or 30% of customers. If something is demonstrably effective, you’ll help implement or share it widely.</li>
  <li>sell products that you’d actually use yourself. Life is too short to represent a product you don’t care about.</li>
  <li>sell products which already have thousands of satisfied customers.</li>
  <li>interact with customers using newer technologies like Docker, Go, React, and Kubernetes as well as established products like PostgreSQL, nginx, and Heroku.</li>
</ul><h3>Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Technical expertise, so you can be useful to software developers and systems engineers. Perhaps you’ve been a sales engineer, customer success engineer, technical account manager or thrived in a “dev bootcamp” program. Maybe you’re writing code now and want a change.</li>
  <li>Able to confidently explain that something costs money (and why!), and ideally, past experience in a sales role. If you have a demonstrated interest in business (like sales, entrepreneurship, or finance), even as a hobby, we want to hear.</li>
  <li>You’re great at explaining complex ideas in writing. This position is 80% email or text, 20% interactive (voice or video)</li>
  <li>Able to confidently give a screenshare-style product demo that attendees enjoy</li>
  <li>You value the chance to help define the process. In past roles, maybe you’ve had strong opinions about how sales could do a better job or how you could do a better job if you were the sales rep.</li>
  <li>Nice to have: Experience interacting with engineers on a daily basis (such as by selling a product to engineers or supporting a product used by engineers), and/or working with a distributed team (such as in Slack)</li>
</ul><h3>Examples of technical expertise</h3><p>Part of this job is identifying customer-specific use cases and opportunities where these products can be more helpful and thus get used more. These are usually technical conversations. To add value, you’ve probably done at least 1 of these 5 tasks or something very similar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>modified a Ruby, Python, Unix shell, or other script/code to do what you want or run correctly (or, of course, written your own)</li>
  <li>cloned a git repo and committed a change</li>
  <li>used a somewhat advanced command-line tool like tcpdump, strace, ntop, iptables, or awk</li>
  <li>booted a Docker container or EC2/Xen instance</li>
  <li>configured a daemon like rsyslog or sshd</li>
</ul><h3>Want to stand out?</h3><p>Sign up for a SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud product (like Librato, Papertrail, or Pingdom), then write an email or record a screencast demo for an imaginary customer. In the email or screencast, explain why this product is a better fit than competitors.</p></div>
