        <div><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. You’re on the front lines to interact with our customers via email and chat predominantly, but we also sprinkle in phone calls and the occasional in-person visit.</p><h3>About The Job</h3><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging work environment. You thrive as an individual contributor and you know how to get shit done. Still wondering whether this is the right role for you? The most successful candidates can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things change all the time, especially with the product.</li>
  <li>Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go.</li>
  <li>Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company everyday, even if that value is created in a repetitive and not so glamorous way. #oneteamonedream</li>
  <li>Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly.</li>
  <li>Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about a bug or product flow that’s confusing for our customers, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem.</li>
  <li>Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!</li>
</ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?</li>
  <li>Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?</li>
  <li>If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?</li>
  <li>What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?</li>
  <li>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</li>
</ul><p>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href="mailto:&#106;o&#98;&#x73;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#112;&#x65;&#x6e;s&#105;&#x66;&#121;.&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#106;o&#98;&#x73;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#112;&#x65;&#x6e;s&#105;&#x66;&#121;.&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</p></div>
