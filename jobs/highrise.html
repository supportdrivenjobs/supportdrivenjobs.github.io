It's grown to become a multi-million dollar business with a strong, loyal customer base. In August 2014, Highrise left the nest, and was spun-off as its own company - a very welcome change for Highrise users, as our users now have their own dedicated development and support team.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>We have a small team that is furiously improving an already well-used application. A lot of people are going to depend on you for help.&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>You can see what our customers say about us (<a href="https://highrisehq.com/love/">https://highrisehq.com/love/</a>) and why we work (<a href="https://highrisehq.com/about/">https://highrisehq.com/about/</a>) on Highrise.&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div><strong>Our current team:</strong></div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Nathan Kontny, CEO&nbsp;</div><div>Software engineer and designer for 15 years.

Also was an engineer on President Obama's re-election campaign. One of the best ways to get to know Nathan is his writing on Signal V. Noise and Ninjas and Robots.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Michael Dwan, CTO&nbsp;</div><div>Michael is a Y Combinator alum and the engineer behind creating an awesome photo application called Snapjoy. Snapjoy was quickly acquired by Dropbox, and you’ll see his handiwork all over what Dropbox has done with Carousel and photo storage.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Lynette Kontny, COO&nbsp;</div><div>You'll see Lynette's work all over Highrise. She makes sure we're all on the same page and getting the right things done quickly.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Jon Phenow, Software Engineer</div><div>Jon is a big reason Highrise continues to improve at a rapid pace.
