        <div><p>The Omni Group is growing our band of Support Humans (also known as our Tech Support team). Our search is for coworkers who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our macOS and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have surprisingly pleasant conversations about software.</p><p>We look for hires with positivity, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t rely on binders of troubleshooting scripts; your imagination will be one of your most important tools.</p><h3>Job Activities</h3><p>When customers call with questions about our Mac &amp; iOS apps, you’re their first contact. Know the answer? Great! If not, gather information and we’ll help you find it. (You should enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more here.)</p><p>When it comes to inventing great software, we believe being friendly is at least as important as being smart. If you need help with a problem, you’ll have plenty of people to ask - and they’ll be happy to talk about it. When we disagree, we do it respectfully. No one furthers themselves by tearing you down.</p><h3>Compensation and Benefits</h3><p>Our amazing customers love our apps and push them to their limits. If earning gratitude by helping them brings you happiness, you’ll enjoy this job. We depend on Support Humans when crafting our products; they speak for and represent our customers’ needs.</p><p>We offer a base salary in the mid-$40k/year range, a 401k with matching, incredible insurance for you and your family, and the potential for profit sharing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We know our industry has a diversity problem; we’re trying to be part of the solution.</p><p>We also offer lots of other great benefits, which you can read about elsewhere on our website. Please see the full job posting and instructions for applying at <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/">https://www.omnigroup.com/jobs/</a>.</p><h3>To Apply</h3><p>To apply, send email to <a href="mailto:resumes@omnigroup.com><a href="mailto:&#114;e&#115;&#x75;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x73;&#64;&#x6f;&#x6d;n&#105;&#x67;&#114;o&#117;&#112;&#46;c&#111;m">&#114;e&#115;&#x75;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x73;&#64;&#x6f;&#x6d;n&#105;&#x67;&#114;o&#117;&#112;&#46;c&#111;m</a></a>; include the exact phrase “Phone Support Human” in the subject line. Include a copy of your résumé in text, HTML, RTF or PDF form. Please note: if you submit a Word document, you will not be considered for the position. No phone calls or visits to the office, please. Every applicant that sends a resume before May 15th will receive a set of sample support questions to work on; applicants will have until May 22nd to submit responses. Those answers are by far the most important factor we’ll use when selecting applicants to invite in for interviews.</p></div>

            <strong>Culture</strong>
            <div><p>The Omni Group is a rewarding but nontraditional place to work, and our compensation packages reflect that. We offer the usual range of traditional benefits to employees:</p><ul><li>Competitive salaries, based on experience.</li><li>Bonuses, based on our revenues and profitability for the year.</li><li>Stock options. (Note that we are not aiming to become publicly traded.)</li><li>401(k), with some company matching, again depending on our revenues and profitability for the year.</li><li>Full health coverage.</li><li>Vision and dental coverage.</li></ul></p><p>But when we founded this business we knew that we were going to spend a ton of time here, so basic survival dictated that it should be fun as well as easy to work in. To those ends, we also have some less traditional benefits:</p><ul><li>Omni has a professional chef and assistants with the power of a restaurant-grade kitchen at their disposal. Dinner is at five o’clock every weeknight; your SO and kids are welcome, too. If you find eating at the office to be impractical, feel free to pack some food up to take home with you.</li><li>Personal hardware purchase budget. Omni provides everything you need to get your job done in the office, but if you need an extra 30” display at home we can help with that too.</li><li>Professional development budget, which covers conferences, training, or materials that you can convince us will help further your work-related skills.</li><li>Corporate matching of personal contributions to 501(c) non-profits, up to a limit.</li><li>A theater, and other media amenities. Miss a WWDC session? Watch it on our hugenormous projector. Fail to watch indie movies when they first came out? Check them out from our movie library!</li><li>A whole mess of console video game systems, both current and old-school. There is a dedicated A/V system for the games, so someone can watch Game of Thrones while others play Rock Band. And of course, we have a large suite of board games, D&D goodies, pinball, and other classic paraphernalia.</li><li>On-site massages.</li></ul><p>But, don’t get the impression we just goof around: it takes a lot of hard work to make our products a joy for our customers. Doing what we do, and doing it the way we choose to, is not easy. Luckily, we all love doing what we do, and we hope you will too.</p><p>Omni is located in rainy Seattle, possibly the most beautiful city in North America. The air here is still clean, the people still friendly, local brands are still more popular than national brands, and music festivals still feel like they are for the people.</p></div>
