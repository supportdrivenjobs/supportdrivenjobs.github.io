        <div><p>Support is Help Scout's bread and butter. We’re pleased to be searching for our sixth, full-time support team member. Our ideal hire is motivated by what we're doing as a company, and eager to contribute on the front lines.</p><h2>About the Role</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a remote position. We’re looking for someone to work Tuesday - Saturday, preferably PST hours.</li>
  <li>You'll be a product expert in all areas. You'll spend most of your days sending timely, human replies to questions via email, but you’ll also create helpful videos, craft documentation, field phone calls, and offer guided tours.</li>
  <li>Customer success is a big piece of the pie. You'll work one-on-one with customers, helping them to get the most out of Help Scout. You might wing unplanned Skype calls and live screen-shares, or schedule meetings to talk about unique use cases.</li>
  <li>We don't hold you to empty policies or procedures. We expect you to always act in the best interest of the customer. You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked. With great power comes great responsibility.</li>
  <li>We’re sticklers about the customer experience. We’re always refining and polishing the product to perfection. As someone on the front line, your understanding of the product and our customers is incredibly valuable. You’ll regularly chat with the product team to make sure we’re getting it right.</li>
</ul><h2>About You</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are a free spirit who thrives in an environment where you can do great work without a ton of oversight.</li>
  <li>You’re passionate about support. You’re in it for the long haul, and you’re not looking for the “next best thing”. This isn’t your first rodeo, nor is it a stepping stone. We’re looking for someone with at least one year of support experience.</li>
  <li>You’re patient and hardy, with an excellent sense of humor. You’re an exceptional listener and educator, and you’re naturally curious with a strong desire to learn.</li>
  <li>You’re an incredible communicator, fluent in written English. You’re just as comfortable on the phone or in person as you are in an email. Your writing is clear and simple, with a proper dose of empathy.</li>
  <li>You have rare people skills that allow you to get out in front of problems, and proactively help customers with potential troubles. You’re a natural people-person. You’re the type of person that goes out of their way to make things right, always.</li>
  <li>You’re have good ole’ fashioned work ethic, day in and day out. You have hustle and take initiative and ownership to see things through to completion. If it needs doing, you do it.</li>
</ul><h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Work anywhere - Work from our office in Boston or anywhere else. For this role we're ideally looking for someone based in the PST timezone, Tuesday - Saturday.</li>
