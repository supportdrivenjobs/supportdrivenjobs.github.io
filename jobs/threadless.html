            <div><p>Threadless is made up of creatives from all over the world who come together to make great art.</p><p>We started with just tees, but tons of products make great canvases. While we work with partners to find these canvases for our artists, it’s our community who makes and picks the best art for us to offer. Whether it’s voted-on art at Threadless.com or designs artists choose to include on their very own Artist Shops, when you buy from us, you support great art. The weird art. The geeky art. The beautiful art.</p><p>We're based in Chicago and have been since we opened our doors in 2000, and we couldn't love our hometown more. We work in an open floor plan office that's covered in amazing urban art, in the center of Chicago's West Loop Neighborhood.</p></div>
