        <div><h3>Who we are:</h3><p>Songkick is the largest concert discovery service and artist-to-fan ticketing platform in the world. Our goal is to help artists sell more tickets directly to their fans and fix the central problem at the heart of the concert industry – that 50% of tickets go unsold. Working with over 500 artists and ticketing thousands of events worldwide each year, we’re working to make every show a sellout.</p><p>Songkick delivers personalized alerts for upcoming concerts to its 10 million monthly unique fans, making it easy for these fans to track their favorite artists so they never miss them live.</p><p>Our company has also powered worldwide programs for some of the world’s biggest artists, including Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire, Imagine Dragons, Blake Shelton, and Paul McCartney, creating the ultimate artist experience by linking fans through innovative ticketing technology and marketing solutions.</p><p>With offices strategically positioned in London, Los Angeles, Nashville, and New York, Songkick combines technology and expertise to make the concert experience better for artists and fans alike.</p><h3>What we’re looking for:</h3><p>We have an opening for an ambitious Graduate to join us at Songkick’s New York or LA offices. This is an opportunity to work with our Customer Support team for a 2 month paid internship.</p><p>We're after someone who is driven by helping people, making them happy and most importantly, someone who understands how much it means to see your favorite band live.

            <strong>Culture</strong>
            <ul class="no-bullet"><p>We believe live music can change your life. We believe there’s no better way to experience music than to see your favorite artist live. It’s an experience that can’t be reproduced, and it’s a lasting memory you share only with those who were there. We want everyone to have this experience.</p>           <p>In the office, we like to keep it casual while knowing when to put that professional step forward. We work hard because we know that playing hard will always follow. We like people who aren’t afraid to take risks, make mistakes, or vigorously disagree. Our culture is one of our most valued assets, and as we grow, we strive to maintain that small start-up feel.</p>           <p>Read more about our culture and check out our 'Life at Songkick' video over on our Jobs page: <a href="http://blog.songkick.com/jobs">http://blog.songkick.com/jobs</a></p</ul>
