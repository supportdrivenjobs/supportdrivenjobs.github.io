            <p>Got questions about 7Geese?<br/>@stinethemachine can answer them in the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/support-driven-chat/">Support Driven Chat</a></p>
        </div>

        <div><p>Support and engagement at 7Geese means delighting with creative and memorable experiences that provide outcome based solutions. We believe that finding and seeking help shouldn't be a chore. Do you think so too?</p><p>Start Date: ASAP</p><p>Minimum Requirements: 1 year customer support experience, preferably at a tech company</p><p>These four key considerations guide what we look for in support hires.</p><p>You invite scrutiny and welcome positivity. Not every interaction is going to involve a yes, but you believe you can still delight and help. Honesty and empathy are your biggest soft-skills.</p><p>You avoid negativity and have integrity. You believe feedback of all kinds helps people improve how solutions are delivered. There's insightful opportunities in every interaction.</p><p>You can demonstrate that you don't play favourites. No one interaction is more important than the next, regardless how grandiose the problem. No question is stupid, but rather provides valuable insight.</p><p>You create structures for learning. Just being responsive and one-time solutions aren't all that. You value helping others learn how to be self-sufficient as well.</p><h3>HERE AT 7GEESE, SUPPORT MEANS YOU...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Are a rockstar at self-prioritizing your work and communicating those priorities to the many people who will need you to help them.</li>
  <li>Find just the right word. You have a natural ability to change your mannerisms to match the tone and expression of who you’re helping, while still maintaining your personality and the 7Geese brand.</li>
  <li>Have experience in support content writing or writing, or just being great with words. There’s nothing worse than the floccinaucinihilipilification of complicated words.</li>
  <li>Are excellent at navigating/learning tech products. Technology doesn’t intimidate you.</li>
  <li>Thrive off learning new things, continuously. You want to progress in your role and take on more responsibility, more opportunities.</li>
  <li>Have the ability to work independently, communicating across multiple time zones. (Don’t worry, you won’t have to work at 1am).</li>
  <li>Are comfortable with debugging and quality testing. You won’t be coding, but you’re comfortable working with developers, working in products like Github and Huboard to stay informed with what’s going on with product development.</li>
  <li>Ensure our customers receive phenomenal support. You know that every bit of work you do makes a real difference in making a customer successful.</li>
  <li>Inspire confidence in the team internally, and more importantly, in our customers. By setting direction, displaying integrity, and moving towards team goals, you’ll leave customers delighted and setup for success.</li>
  <li>Lead by example by providing delightful conversation-centric customer support.</li>
  <li>Work with team members to implement process improvements, customer workflow improvements, and be a kick-ass support team.</li>
</ul><h3>BREAKDOWN OF HOW YOUR TIME WILL BE SPENT:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>50% Reactive support via Intercom (incoming support questions, e-mails, phone calls, and potential visits). You know the product inside and out; other teams come to fact-check things with you like "Can a person with this permission do this?"</li>
  <li>25% Writing and maintaining content for our learning center and knowledge base. If there's nothing new to update, you're researching new best practices and creating new resources to add.</li>
  <li>10% Bug tracking and quality testing. As things get reported, you stay in the know and act as liaison between development/product and the customer.</li>
  <li>10% Pro-active engagement (re-engagement emails, developing engagement campaigns to help champion our customers through ideal customer journeys).</li>
  <li>5% Reporting for monthly and quarterly meetings. Tracking KPIs, suggesting other metrics to track based on our goals, summarizing things like top 3 reasons for tickets in a given time period with suggested solutions.</li>
</ul><h3>YOUR EXPERIENCE!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You have a minimum of 1 year customer support experience.</li>
  <li>You have demonstrated superhero like qualities in your current situation and are ready to soar into a new opportunity and take on a large project of your own</li>
  <li>Know about the tech industry and what goes into making a team work well collaboratively</li>
  <li>Can demonstrate how you excel in our 3 core value areas: excellent, positivity, and growth</li>
  <li>Are communication driven with experience explaining complex problems in easy ways</li>
  <li>Have experience delivering solutions to others that help them move forward</li>
