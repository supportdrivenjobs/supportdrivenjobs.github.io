        <div><p>7Geese is seeking an energetic and talented Customer Support Manager with a passion for helping customers and a relentless desire to improve customer support best practices.</p><p>In this role, you will own customer support interactions, resources, processes, and strategy. You will work very closely with the Customer Success and Product Development teams to collaborate on support resources and engagement projects.</p><p>At 7Geese, customer support means delighting customers with positive and memorable experiences that provide outcome-based solutions. We believe that finding and seeking help shouldn't be a chore. Do you agree?</p><p>Start Date: ASAP</p><h3>Our guide to hiring rockstar support teammates:</h3><p>You invite scrutiny and exude positivity. Not every interaction is going to involve a ‘yes’, but you believe you can still delight and offer help. Honesty and empathy are your biggest soft-skills.</p><p>You avoid negativity and have integrity. You believe feedback of all kinds can lead to improvement. There are insightful opportunities in every interaction.</p><p>You are proactive and love teaching others. Simply being responsive and giving one-time solutions doesn’t meet 7Geese standards. You value helping others become self-sufficient and enjoy creating structures and resources for learning.</p><h3>HERE AT 7GEESE, SUPPORT MEANS YOU...</h3>
