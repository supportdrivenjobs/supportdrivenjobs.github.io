  <li>Foster long-term relationships with customers to retain and grow our customer base.</li>
  <li>Perform with grace under pressure and maintain composure and friendliness even when dealing with frustrated or impatient users.</li>
  <li>Help document product features and create video tutorials aimed at existing and new customers to evangelize products.</li>
  <li>Work independently with minimal daily oversight, while also contributing to and collaborating with a close-knit team.</li>
  <li>Identify, brainstorm, and initiate opportunities to improve or expand training materials, including but not limited to our support database, video and text tutorials, integration and set-up guides, and original webinars and online courses.</li>

  <li>College degree or equivalent experience in a related field</li>

Use them before they expire.” There will be times where a new project needs to happen within weeks, and other times where we’re working on something taking place 6 months out.</p><p>My time and energy is precious and I’ll need you to uphold strong boundaries, and discern what needs my attention and what you can handle on your own.</p><p>I’m a Type A with a lot of heart, and I care equally about your happiness and getting results.</p><p>I’m risk averse, and I trust my intuition in business, so you might find that we change our plans when I get a gut feeling to do so.</p><p>I keep my commitments and pay my bills on time.</p><p>I spend my money wisely, and re-invest into the business.</p><p>I appreciate fast communication turnaround time, but I generally prefer to take week-ends off and recommend you do the same.</p></div>
