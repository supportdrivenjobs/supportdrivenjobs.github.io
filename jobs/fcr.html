            <div><p>Our people are the driving force behind our success and without them, FCR could not achieve the phenomenal growth we have seen every year. We hire smart, hardworking, and dedicated people who like to learn, are creative and take customer service to a whole new level. We work hard, but we also play hard and like to have fun. If you’re going to spend 8 or more hours at a place of work, it might as well be fun, right?</p><p>Our colleagues are the most important asset we have, and we embrace all of their individual characteristics that make them who they are. Instead of trying to make everyone fit into a box of conformity, we encourage creative thoughts and ideas from every level of our organization. No one person is more important than the other and we all have a voice at FCR.</p><p>We provide every new colleague the training they need to be successful within our company and coach and develop each person individually to help improve performance where needed. With the right skill set, drive, and initiative, every colleague has the opportunity to progress upward at FCR and we focus on promoting colleagues from within.</p></div>
