        <div><p>GitHub is looking for full-time Enterprise Support Engineers to provide Japanese-language support for our customers in Japan.</p><p>More and more companies are using GitHub Enterprise, so our global Enterprise Support Team is quickly growing.

  <li>Manage urgent customer outages during business hours</li>

  <li>General understanding of how modern web applications work</li>
  <li>Prior experience providing technical support</li>

  <li>Enthusiasm for working directly with customers</li>
  <li>Stellar Japanese and grammar skills</li>
  <li>Business level English skills</li>
