        <div><p>Are you interested in genuinely helping people on a daily basis? Do you understand what it means to truly deliver a world class customer experience?</p><p>At Stretch Internet, our above-all-else focus on supporting our clients defines who we are as a company. We empower our support specialists, daily, to help us establish and deliver on our industry-leading brand of customer service. We’ve been providing streaming services for collegiate athletic departments for more than 12 years and we are the largest streaming provider in the industry, with a client base of more than 500 colleges and universities. We’re looking for team members that can take a new topic, become an expert on it – with training provided, of course – and apply that expertise in a way that truly dazzles (think virtual jazz hands). If you get excited by the prospect of working around sports for a living and appreciate the idea of working on a small, but close-knit team, this could be the job for you!</p><h3>You are:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An outstanding communicator (both written and spoken) – think 9 or better on a scale of 1 to 10</li>
  <li>Able to quickly and efficiently communicate with coworkers in an often fast-paced environment</li>
  <li>The person in your circle of friends that everybody seeks out when they’re having an issue with technology</li>
  <li>Appreciative of spectacular service and recognize what sets it apart from the average interaction</li>
  <li>Someone who ascribes to our seven key values as outlined above – especially the first two (“Be kind” and “Be positive”)</li>
  <li>Able to put anyone at ease through natural, easy-going conversation (If you’re on an airplane for three hours, you can navigate that fine line of friendly conversation vs. endless badgering)</li>
  <li>A cool customer - you never get rattled and your friends often wonder if there’s anything that could make you angry</li>
  <li>Self-motivated – when there is downtime, you are not sitting idly by… you would rather find something new to learn or tinker with</li>
</ul><h3>You have:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At least 1-2 years of experience in some field involving customer service interaction and/or high-capacity communication</li>
  <li>Willingness to work at least 1-3 nights per week and full shifts on Saturdays (from late August through May) and occasional Sunday shifts</li>
  <li>Experience working with Macs</li>
  <li>A desire to develop and nurture client relationships</li>
  <li>Openness to being taught &amp; coached – while we encourage our staff to insert their personality (one of our core values is “Be Yourself”), we do have a well-developed voice that we want each of our support specialists to embrace</li>
</ul><h3>Why Stretch?</h3><p>We think Stretch is a pretty awesome place to work, and we think you might agree. Check out some of the perks we offer:<br/>- Laid back environment - wear shorts and flip flops to the office if that’s your thing<br/>- We have fun on a daily basis – ping-pong, darts, pool, sports… somehow we still manage to get work done<br/>- Fully stocked kitchen and catered lunches on Saturdays<br/>- Flexible vacation (3 weeks plus option to buy additional vacation in the summer)<br/>- Optional benefits include health insurance and retirement account with employee match</p></div>

            <strong>Culture</strong>
            <div><p>Our mission at Stretch Internet is simple – “to provide a streaming platform backed by over-the-top, freakishly good customer support from every single employee in every single interaction.” We’ve identified seven values that drive our culture: 1) Be kind, 2) Be positive, 3) Be a team player, 4) Be zealous, 5) Be innovative, 6) Be an explorer, 7) Be yourself. We provide a casual environment with plenty of chances to get to know your colleagues over darts, pool and ping-pong. And, since we’re a sports-driven company, there’s a screen with some kind of game on it at nearly every turn.</p></div>
