        <div><p>Hiya. Weâ€™re SkyVerge and we love eCommerce. Our products help merchants manage and grow their online stores, all the way from boutique corner shop to Fortune 500 retailers. Weâ€™re looking for two Customer Support Specialists to join our fully-distributed team and help support our entire suite of products.</p><h3>The Role</h3><p>Youâ€™ll be the first point of contact for our customers, helping them with problems, and answering questions. As part of a small team, you'll likely get your hands dirty with a little bit of everything.</p><p>Here are some things you may do on a given day:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assist customers by troubleshooting technical problems and escalating to the engineering team as needed</li>
  <li>Answer pre-sales questions, billing &amp; account changes, and other feedback from customers</li>
  <li>Monitor social media and forums where customers may have questions or issues with our products and get them the help they need</li>
  <li>Help with customer onboarding by installing and modifying code on customersâ€™ stores</li>
  <li>Write technical documentation and other content so customerâ€™s can help themselves</li>
  <li>Help our engineering &amp; product teams to identify areas where we can improve the customer experience</li>
  <li>Document and optimize our support process to improve customer satisfaction</li>
</ul><p>With over 70 products across the three eCommerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads) that we support, there's plenty to learn. Youâ€™ll be expected to own the support queue for a set of products for a week before rotating to another set. Weâ€™re aiming for you to have broad knowledge (mile-wide, inch-deep) and work closely with the product &amp; engineering team to tackle more technical or in-depth questions that go beyond your knowledge.</p><h3>You</h3><p>You have that unique combination of technical aptitude and empathy for the user. Youâ€™re comfortable with code but prefer to be customer-facing. Youâ€™re self-driven with a sense of urgency and draw satisfaction from going above and beyond to provide solutions. Youâ€™re an excellent communicator and have the ability to thrive in a distributed environment. Perhaps most importantly, you have a willingness to learn.</p><p>To succeed in this position, you will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>solid understanding of HTML / CSS</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of JavaScript</li>
  <li>Native-level fluency in English (Are you fluent in other languages? Tell us! We love being able to support customers in their native language.)</li>
  <li>Outstanding written communication and interpersonal skills</li>
  <li>Boundless curiosity for our products and our customers</li>
  <li>Ability to thrive in a remote environment (along with a reliable internet connection)</li>
</ul><p>Itâ€™s helpful if you have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experience with PHP / Ruby (or other programming languages)</li>
  <li>Experience with WordPress</li>
  <li>Experience with Shopify / WooCommerce (or other eCommerce platforms)</li>
  <li>Experience supporting SaaS products</li>
  <li>Experience supporting downloadable software (especially in the LAMP stack)</li>
</ul><p>Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, GitHub, and weekly stand-ups on Monday via Zoom (a few short meetings on Monday) â€” we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time thatâ€™s free of distractions.</p><p>As a remote team, we believe that regular meet-ups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. Curious about these trips? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip) to get an idea of what theyâ€™re like.</p><p>This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with thoughtful replies to customers, wiki edits, and published documentation.</p><h3>Process</h3><p>Qualified candidates will get an email with a few questions to answer via email. Following that, youâ€™ll have a few 30 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.</p><p>If this goes well, weâ€™ll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day Bootcamp. This is a trial period where youâ€™ll work full-time as a contractor, or part-time on nights/weekends if you already have a full-time position. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. Weâ€™ll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure weâ€™re on the same page. At the end of the 30 days, youâ€™ll be offered a permanent position ðŸ™‚</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>Here are some benefits we're excited to offer to our team members:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Competitive salary</li>
  <li>Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals</li>
  <li>25 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June ðŸ˜€)</li>
  <li>Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>
  <li>401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>
  <li>Work from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection</li>
  <li>The tools (hardware/software) you need to be productive</li>
  <li>Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)</li>
  <li>Home office or co-working allowance</li>
  <li>A Kindle to help you keep learning</li>
</ul><p>We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.</p></div>
