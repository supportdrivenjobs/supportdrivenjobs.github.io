        <div><p>If you ever found yourself paying $40 for a cup of coffee (and you’re not insane) then you’re already familiar with the problem we’re trying to solve - overdrafts. Dave.com outsmarts overdrafts by predicting your future expenses and unlocking your upcoming paycheck. Instead of charging interest or predatory fees, Dave lets users decide what is fair to pay in an effort to disrupt the $38bn in overdraft fees banks collected in 2016 alone.</p><p>That’s right. 0% interest. All we ask is that you tip us if we helped you. It was a crazy social experiment based on the belief that people are inherently good. We are happy to report that this is the case.</p><p>That said, compassion for others is key to our company culture and hopefully a value you cherish. Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.</p><p>Your role is crucial as it informs everything we do - from marketing to product development. You are our eyes and ears on the ground. You'll not only help with customer support but you'll also take an active lead in crafting our voice on social media. By talking directly with customers, you'll develop insight as to exactly who our target audience is and how best to communicate with them to help serve their needs. One hand feeds the other.</p><p>We are started by a 4X entrepreneur ($85mm exit) and are backed by investors like Mark Cuban, SV Angel, The Chernin Group, David Friedberg, The Kraft Group, SRI, Diplo and more. We have great healthcare, cute office dogs, a patio to get your daily intake of Vitamin D and a basketball hoop to get you from slouching. But more important than all this stuff, we’re sick of people getting ripped off by banks and predatory lenders. We’re not a budgeting app. That’s for rich people. We’re here to help the majority of Americans living between the coasts. But it’s cool, we love LA and hope you do too.</p><h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prior experience in tech support, banking or insurance is a big plus.</li>
  <li>Excellent grammar and communication skills.</li>
  <li>Social media marketing experience.</li>
  <li>Be a good human being.</li>
</ul></div>

Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.</p><p><b>TRANSPARENCY:</b><br/>Customers come to us out of frustration with their banks’ hidden fees and shady tactics that actually encourage overdraft. Dave practices full transparency in order to win the trust of our customers. Instead of charging interest for our advances, we let our customers decide to pay what’s fair with an optional tip.</p><p><b>SERVICE:</b><br/>We believe that customer service is a differentiating factor for success. We aren’t just building products. We are helping people. For as data-driven as we are, we are first and foremost human-centered. Dave is dependable and steps in to help when friends and family can’t. We hope you’re the same.</p></div>
