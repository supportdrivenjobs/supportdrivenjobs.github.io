        <div><p>Appointlet is a Portland, OR based SaaS startup that is making life easier for sales teams by eliminating the back-and-forth of scheduling calls and video conferences with customers &amp; prospects. If you've ever seen a "Schedule Demo" button on a website or in emails, we want to be that button.</p><p>We provide our customers with a widget that let’s their prospects easily book a time to be given a product or service demo. After the visitor books a time, it’s added to the company’s calendar so they can focus on selling.</p><p>Our software is small, but the impact it has on our customers is huge.</p><p>Who this is for:</p><p>This position is for someone that…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Has excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.</li>
  <li>Is extremely patient and nice, even when the customer isn’t.</li>
  <li>Knows (generally) how the SaaS industry works.</li>
  <li>Loves solving problems. Every customer is different so being able to meet their specific needs and go above and beyond to provide them with additional value is a must.</li>
  <li>Doesn’t want to work for a corporate machine. There are two of us, so you’ll be the third.</li>
  <li>Is self-motivated and able to stay productive without supervision.</li>
  <li>Wants reasonably flexible hours and a laid back work environment.</li>
</ul><p>What you'll do:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Explain the benefits of Appointlet to visitors and help on-board them when they sign up.</li>
  <li>Maintaining our knowledge base by adding/updating guides and frequently asked questions.</li>
  <li>Researching and implementing techniques to improve customer retention.</li>
  <li>Forming relationships with our bigger customers and checking in on them.</li>
  <li>Experiment: this is a startup so you’ll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything.</li>
