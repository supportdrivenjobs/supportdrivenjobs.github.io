        <div><h3>You...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Are good at seeing things from other people’s point of view</li>
  <li>Strive to take care of others like you would take care of your own family</li>
  <li>Love to build relationships with customers</li>
  <li>Want to take customer care to the next level</li>
  <li>Emulate other companies that provide amazing service: Disney, Chick-Fil-A, Nordstrom, Ritz-Carlton, Trader Joe’s, and Zappos are some great examples</li>
  <li>See the value in having a rabid, loyal customer base</li>
  <li>Embrace change</li>
  <li>Push for excellence</li>
</ul><h3>Who we are</h3><p>We’ve been certifying people in CPR, first aid, and bloodborne pathogens since 2003. Not only that -- we’ve been increasing in size, training more people, adding more trainings, and getting bigger and stronger every year since.</p><p>We are a collaborative, growing team that creates and supports the world’s best training. Our online health and safety courses help save lives every day (literally -- we have heard countless stories from our customers who have saved the lives of loved ones after using our training).</p><p>We work out of an awesome, open building in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><h3>What we believe</h3><p>Providing life-saving training is a noble pursuit that is worth getting up every morning to create.</p><p>We believe that every team member is crucial and makes a difference, which is why we hire highly-motivated, hard-working, well-rounded people who pursue excellence in everything they do. That’s also why we’re very selective and particular about hiring great people, especially in this position, as you will be the face of our company to many of our customers.</p><p>We think that surprising and delighting our customers at every turn makes life-long, loyal supporters who rave about you to their friends; not to mention, it helps make the world a better place to live!</p><p>We believe that training should be FREE, because nobody should have to take out their wallet to learn how to save a life. In fact, we believe this so strongly, we created a StudentCPR program that trains thousands of high school students every single year.</p><p>We believe that you can work really hard and still have a ton of fun. You can play ping pong to blow off steam, chat with customers from our ceiling suspended hammock chair, and play games with co-workers at the office at night. Work and fun are not mutually exclusive -- having a good work-life balance is critical to loving your job and doing great work.</p><p>We love innovation. We don’t like to do things like everyone else. A great example is our Single Use Manikin Option (SUMO). For the first time in the history of CPR training, people are able to complete their entire certification without leaving home.</p><h3>What you’ll be doing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Delighting our customers by forming real relationships with them (through phone, email, and chat), including sending out postcards and follow-up emails to show our appreciation</li>

  <li>Providing insightful advice and friendly support to ProTrainings customers in need</li>
  <li>Quickly diagnosing problems on the spot, determining and explaining situations with patience and empathy so our customers can get trained and get back to work</li>
  <li>Taking ownership of every customer interaction -- we empower you to make decisions and care for customers in creative ways -- no robots here</li>
  <li>Collaborating with other departments to WOW our customers</li>
  <li>Learning and growing professionally by taking time every week to read articles or books from our bookshelf to better yourself</li>
  <li>Working 12pm - 8pm or 9am - 5pm (EST) with the possibility of alternating shift coverage</li>
  <li>We are open to remote workers who have a great work ethic, are self-motivated, and do great work without direct supervision</li>
</ul><h3>Desired experience</h3><p>You have worked in a customer-relations role in the past, whether that was as a receptionist, a call center rep, nursing assistant, barista, bank teller, anything in retail, or any other position in which you helped and delighted customers.</p><h3>Basic skills we’re looking for</h3>
