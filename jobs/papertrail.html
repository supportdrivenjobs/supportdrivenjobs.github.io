        <div><p><a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> provides log management as a service. We work with tens of thousands of ops-savvy developers, systems engineers, and entrepreneurs at companies like GitHub, Heroku, Instacart, Adobe, and DNSimple.</p><p>That's where you come in. We've grown to need technical customer support to help customers make the most of Papertrail. Here's a few examples of what customers think of Papertrail's support:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TiuTalk/status/714592766827872257">https://twitter.com/TiuTalk/status/714592766827872257</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/agmakonts/status/730356796607614976">https://twitter.com/agmakonts/status/730356796607614976</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/hectcastro/status/717523363032391680">https://twitter.com/hectcastro/status/717523363032391680</a></p><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Put smiles on the faces of fellow engineers</li>
  <li>Remote work is welcome</li>
  <li>100% online (email, Slack/Campfire text chat), no phones</li>
  <li>Startup atmosphere and tools, public company benefits</li>
</ul><h2>Okay, cool. What's involved?</h2><p>Help customers setup and use Papertrail's service in email and text chat. The questions are about a wide range of topics like Linux, syslog, Web framework logging, Ruby, Rails, IP stack troubleshooting, PHP, REST/JSON, Python, firewall rules, Node.js, plus non-technical topics.</p><p>You almost certainly won't know about all of these. While a strong working knowledge of Linux is required, Googling to satisfy your own curiosity is a lot more valuable (and hopefully, fun). Also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be comfortable and personable in email, even when interacting with strangers.</li>
  <li>Show a passion for devops tools, Web services, and technology in general. We're doing this because we love it.</li>
</ul><h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Working Linux knowledge</strong>. You've compiled a binary, installed packages, and understand TCP/IP concepts. Experience with tools like <code>tcpdump</code> or <code>strace</code> will help, though it isn't required.</li>
  <li><strong>Fantastic casual writing skills</strong>. This job involves helping people in email, forums, and text chat, so a written voice goes a long way. Good grammar is critical, as is a gut feel for when to ignore it in order to make a personal connection. When a friend emails you a question, do you spend 10 minutes Googling and send them a ridiculously thoughtful answer? You'll fit right in. A public online history (like a blog, Stack Overflow/Server Fault posts, GitHub commit history, Twitter account, or casual posts to non-technical online forums) is ideal, since a big part of this job is showing your passion and knowledge for a topic in casual, freeform emails.</li>
  <li><strong>Scripting</strong>. Experience in a scripting or programming language, ideally in one or more of Ruby, Python, Go, Java, or C.</li>
  <li><strong>Location and timezone</strong>. Able to work in US, Canada, or Europe on a roughly UTC-7 workday. Although we're completely location-agnostic, employment law is not.</li>
</ul><h2>Why's this is unusually awesome?</h2><p>It's the most important thing we do. Happy customers are the only reason why we get to do this every day. Since most of our interactions with customers are via support, this is the most important thing we do every day and the main reason we grow. It's:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flexible.</strong> Papertrail's hub is a Slack text chat channel. Work in a coffee shop without missing office conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal</strong>. You'll be part of a tiny team, working side by side with the founders. Debating product decisions is a lot more fun because we're all target users â€“ 100% of Papertrail staff has sent a GitHub pull request.</li>
  <li><strong>The tip of the iceberg</strong>. Although answering questions is the must-have, you're welcome to write docs, improve our open-source apps, or grow into coding on the core service. We operate in 3 thriving fields: cloud computing, software as a service, and dev/ops, and the tools we use are in demand: Ruby, Java/Scala, and current open-source libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>Predictable</strong>. As part of SolarWinds, Papertrail offers excellent benefits, including paid health insurance and 401(k) match. If you're in San Francisco or Austin, you're welcome to come in to a physical office.</li>
