        <div><h3>About You</h3><p>You are passionate about creating an amazing experience for customers. You might have experience in sales, marketing, support, services, or teaching. Any role where you contributed to creating an amazing experience for others using a combination of one-to-one and one-to-many interactions. Segment is a super technical product, so you should be excited to learn about the product; a proven track record of going deep on a complicated topic is a big plus. If you have experience in our industry (SaaS, data, analytics, digital marketing) that’s an even bigger plus!</p><h3>About the Role</h3><p>This role is all about getting to know our non-technical customers and leading projects to drastically improve their experience. You’ll handle one-to-one email interactions like helping customers understand what Segment is, getting them comfortable with our site, and working through best practices. Providing amazing support is important, but to be a top performer in this role you’ll spend most of your time on projects that empower customers to work through issues on their own. Projects you’ll lead might include: recording walkthrough videos, writing help guides, hosting virtual demos for groups of new customers, anything goes! You’ll be in charge of prioritizing new projects based on interactions with customers and what you think will create the best overall customer experience.</p><p>As part of the Customer Experience team you’ll work closely with our technical support team since they’ll be your main escalation point when customers get to the point of implementing Segment.

  <li>Consolidate customer feedback and issues with the product, messaging, and pricing to share across all teams in the company</li>
  <li>Create content that enables customers to get setup with Segment without emailing support</li>
  <li>Prioritize and lead projects that help customers understand the value of Segment</li>
  <li>Be an advocate for amazing customer experience by working with other teams at Segment (product, engineering, design, marketing, growth, sales, technical support)</li>
</ul><h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Proven history of going above and beyond for customers</li>
  <li>Interested in Segment and our industry</li>
  <li>Extremely people-centric and empathetic</li>
  <li>You have a knack for planning and creating helpful content</li>
  <li>Strong desire to meet goals, both personal and as part a team</li>
  <li>Must be located in the San Francisco Bay area or willing to re-locate</li>
</ul><p>You’ll be joining a team that loves making life easier for people. We care deeply about our customers and partners, and we judge ourselves on how well we serve them.
