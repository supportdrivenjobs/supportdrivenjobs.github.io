The right person for this job will be a rapid and passionate learner who wants to do amazing things.\n\nIf you love the prospect of changing the world’s perception of customer support as a short term job opportunity, are excited by the opportunity to develop true thought leadership in the space and the opportunity to build a great software business by placing our customer at the heart of it, you’ve found perfect company.\n\n(* OK, dressing room negotiable.)\n\n### Responsibilities, goals and things you'd be working on\n- Lead and grow the Kayako customer support team (based all around the world, with two principal locations being our offices: London and New Delhi.)\n- Plan and deliver projects to level up the Kayako customer experience and drive CSAT and NPS.\n- Collaborate with customer success to develop a holistic customer strategy and resources covering contact, operations, tooling, self-service and onboarding to drive customer loyalty, reduce customer effort and customer churn.\n- Day-to-day management of the customer support team including training and development, mentoring, ongoing scheduling of support coverage and the reporting and monitoring of metrics.\n- Collaborate with product and marketing to improve the Kayako product offering and value proposition, and help turn the support function into an insights engine.\n- Develop and own collaborative processes across channels, departments and the Kayako community to improve the support journey for our users.\n- Build thought leadership by translating our learnings and methodologies into content, blogging, community participation and speaking at events.\n \n### Skills, qualifications and experience required\n- Minimum of 2 years experience leading and building customer support and service teams specifically for software products, and 4 years experience leading teams generally.\n- Successful in and being responsible for recruiting, interviewing, compensating and developing  talent.\n- A voracious learner and reader (there is no degree in building the Kayako business - we need to relearn everything we thought we knew, every year.) Kayako is a growth-stage startup. With around nearly 100 people around the world, this is the perfect opportunity to join a still nascent team and shape your own role as we grow. \n- A consistent track  record as a hands-on, cross-functional member of the team who leads from the front, and is always willing to dive in and always able to step back.\n- Very comfortable with wrangling with data and customer metrics.\n- A solid understanding of the challenges of building a customer support and service functions across different industries and verticals.\n- Excellent written and oral communication along with technical fluency, CRM and customer communication tool experience, such as Kayako, Salesforce, Hubspot, HootSuite.\n- Very comfortable working in and coordinating collaboration with other functions and in a team environment. \n\n### You'd love this role if\n- You love working with people and seeing them grow to their full potential with coaching and development.\n- You’d relish the challenge of developing new metrics to measure the customer experience and helping our product team create new tools to improve it.\n- You love working out of silos and are keen to deploy your expertise and expand your knowledge across all areas of the customer journey and product.\n- You don't see owning your own territory as a reflection of your individual success, but rather the success of your team and the wins we achieve together.\n- You have ambition to become a thought leader and make a name for yourself as a high performing leader in a fast pace SaaS startup.\n- You’re already a member of the customer support community (blogging, Elevate Summit, UserConf, Support Driven, etc.)\n\n### Other reasons why you’ll love working at Kayako\n- Stock options - we want everyone to be invested in the success of their work.\n- Unlimited PTO - take time off as you need it.\n- Pension - we’ll contribute to your pension so you can plan for the future.\n- Private health insurance package - including a 50% discount gym membership, because we want to be and stay healthy.\n- Choose your own gear - we want you to have all the tools you need to do the work best.\n- Flexible working hours - we love spending time in the office together and think we’re at our best in-person, but we’re realistic and flexible about it.\n- Family friendly  - we operate a childcare vouchers scheme for all our employees.\n- Monthly on-site massage - yes, we have someone come in once a month. No, it’s not weird.\n- Fully stocked fridge and pantry - keeping you  going. Standard.\n- Weekly craft beers and wines - every Friday. No reason or explanation needed. And we won’t judge you if you wanted to start on Thursday, either.\n- Weekly fruit delivery - to compensate for the weekly beers.\n- Weekly team lunches - because we like food, and we love bonding over it.\n- Regular learning opportunities - from Lunch n’ Learns to opportunities to attend the best industry events, we want you to grow in every way possible.\n\n### Location\n\nOur preference would be for this key leadership role to be based locally in our office in London. We're happy to sponsor a visa where possible. However, for the right candidate, we will also consider a remote position - significant experience building and managing a global support team remotely would be a requirement.\n\n### Equal opportunities (it is boilerplate, but we believe it)\n\nKayako is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability or age.","publish_date":"2016-10-10"},{"feature":"true","link":"jobs/github-web-apac.html","location":"Asia Pacific (Remote)","published":"Sep 30","id":13,"title":"GitHub Web Support Accounts Manager Asia Pacific (Remote)","body":"\nGitHub's user base is growing and the web support team is growing with it.

But what about all those people out there who could use a little extra push? Well, That’s where you come in, dear reader - we’re looking for a User Outreach Specialist who can lead the charge on identifying and nurturing leads, leading product demos, and whatever else our pre-customers might need!\n\n### About You\nYou’re a take-charge sort of guy/gal/non-binary individual - somebody who can tell when a person needs a nudge or three in the right direction, and proactively gives them the information they need to make their own brilliant decisions. You’re not a salesperson - you’re a matchmaker, setting people up with bliss-inducing solutions to their most problem-y problems.\nIn this position, that means working with our marketing team to do things like:\n\n- Identify and nurture leads via email, social media, and more\n- Conduct personalized one-on-one demos as needed\n- Respond to emails and online chats from our leads\n- Transition new customers into our onboarding process\n\nSometimes, the people who’ll benefit most from your help and expertise will come to you - other times, you’ll seek them out yourself. That means you’re someone who understands the weird lil’ intersection of social media, SaaS products, and content marketing where Edgar lives, and the issues that are important to anyone else in that neighborhood. \n\nHow can you tell when what we offer is what someone’s looking for? How do you communicate that - and how does your strategy change from person to person? What matters most to one type of lead versus another, and how do you help them meet their needs? These are the types of questions you’ll be answering in this position - so be ready! (Sorry, we totally didn’t give you a spoiler alert beforehand.)\n\nBecause this role requires significant interaction with potential customers, you’ll work alongside both our Marketing and Customer Experience teams to make our relationships with our leads better than ever. From conducting proactive outreach to responding to the needs of prospective users, your day-to-day will be the types of one-on-one interactions that a people person’s dreams are made of!\n\n### Job Deets Cheat Sheet\n- This is a full-time, salaried remote position - you must live somewhere in North America and be able to show eligibility to work in the USA\n- Sales/marketing experience a plus\n- Customer service experience also preferred, ideally with technology-related products/services\n- An extrovert’s love of reaching out to new people (an introvert’s love of staying at home is okay, though)\n- Able to read a situation and determine someone’s needs - even if they don’t spell them out for you\n- Confident hosting live demos, Q&A sessions, and sing-a-longs\n- Demonstrably good judgment\n\n### About Us\nWe’re a small team of 18-ish people, all working remotely across the US & Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual retreat week where we work together on cool projects all day and rock the karaoke mic all night. (Spoiler alert: This means you have to be willing and able to travel to those retreats! The karaoke, however, is optional.) \nWe’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks. \n\nWe'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)\n\nYou can find out more at http://meetedgar.com/careers/ and by watching this video (please watch it, it was mad expensive):\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvU3P43b0rQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Perks & Benefits\n- Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)\n- 4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam!
