We’re looking forward to getting to know you better, but you probably want to know what you’re getting yourself into. You can check out our careers page, or read on.\n\nAt Customer.io, our mission is helping businesses talk like people. Today, we do this with messaging software that allows businesses with large user-bases to send targeted, more relevant communication at scale.\n\n### A day in the life of a Deliverability Specialist\nA Deliverability Specialist at Customer.io helps new and existing customers get up and running in our product, diagnose tricky situations related to email deliverability, and achieve their business goals. Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) and a Deliverability Specialist on our Technical Support Team has contact with more customers than anyone else in the company.\n\n### What skills will you bring to the table?\nFirst and foremost, we’re looking for someone with experience diagnosing and solving email deliverability issues. We’re also looking for some customer support experience, responding mainly via email within a remote/async environment. Ideally you’ve worked with or supported email marketing/business communication tools, too. You should be comfortable with basic programming concepts (API, variables, if-else statements, loops, etc.). You’re willing to work in US Eastern hours on a regular basis.\n\n### Your contributions to the team will include:\n- being the expert on the team for any deliverability questions or problems our customers may have\n- identifying ways deliverability rates can be higher including working with partner sites and services to mitigate the risk of any future blacklisting.\n- establishing tools that can monitor the list of our IP addresses to proactively head off any blacklist issues.\n- building processes and procedures to ensure the entire team can work seamlessly to help our customers when deliverability issues arise.\n\nBeyond your focus on deliverability, you’ll develop deep product, systems and customer knowledge by supporting our customers via email.  You’ll also work on internal and external documentation and have regular touch points with our Product and Development teams to discuss feature requests, usability issues and user scenarios. You’ll bring your passion for customers and their problems to advocate for product improvements and provide insight that will help us make sure we build the right thing.\n\nIn the long run there are opportunities to apply that to automate processes and create internal tools or to join our Customer Success team which helps our high revenue customers make the most of our product. We have many new features to build and ideas to implement, so there will be plenty of exciting challenges ahead.\n\nToday the Technical Support team is powered by Help Scout for tickets, Github Issues for bug tracking and Zapier to help automate some of our support processes.\n\nAlthough, we mostly interact with each other through Basecamp and Slack and value focused work, we’re not afraid to jump on a Screenhero pairing session or a video call to clarify customer scenarios or share tips on how to troubleshoot issues better.\n\n \n\n### You’ll be joining a team of 4 including:\n<b>Wendy Teo</b> - Director of Technical Support - lovingly referred to as unicorn because she’s fantastic AND elusive (we rarely get to see her whole face)\n\nAnd our Technical Support Engineers:<br/> \n<b>Brandi Young</b> - resident Texan, considers eminem her guilty pleasure and is perfectly introverted and awkward.\n\n<b>Wiley Jenkins</b> - from coffee stand to tech, and most recently, Customer.io; Wiley will make you smile.\n\n<b>Dan Schales</b> - Star Wars expert, enjoying family life in Washington State; Dan’s the support(man).\n\nThe folks above are an incredible group, and we’re excited for you to meet them. If you’re still reading this, then you’ll share some qualities with them like:\n\n- You love technical problem solving\n- You enjoy helping others with your technical knowledge and take pride in your work.\n- You see every support ticket as an opportunity to improve the customer experience.\n- You take ownership of delivering results and get satisfaction from getting things done.\n- You’re passionate about learning new things.\n- You’re not afraid to ask questions if you’re confused about how something works.\n- You understand written communication is not always perfect and assume the best intentions during interactions with customers and your team. Empathy is one of your strongest attributes.\n \n### Why should you work with Customer.io?\nWe want to enable you to do your best work, and this is how we aim to do that—\n\n<b>Salary:</b> We’re offering $70,000 USD for this position in the company.\n\n<b>Equity:</b> You’ll own a piece of the company. It's not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we're planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it may be a nice bonus.\n\n<b>Big impact:</b> Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company, both with our product and our culture.\n\n<b>Great tools:</b> Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you'd like to get your job done.\n\n<b>Health benefits:</b> We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental and vision.\n\n<b>Paid Parental & Medical Leave</b> - including adoption\n\n<b>Retreats:</b> We want everyone in our company to connect in person whenever possible, so we get everyone together once a year. We've had retreats in Barcelona, Romania, and Hunter Mountain, NY. We’re going to Iceland in September!\n\n<b>Vacation:</b> Rest and recuperation are important. We offer unlimited paid time off with a two week minimum per year.\n\n### Diversity at Customer.io\nAt Customer.io, we’re committed to building a diverse environment, and encourage minority applicants. So far, we have team members in Scotland, Germany, Canada, and all over the US. Our CEO and CTO grew up in Singapore and Arkansas respectively, but met in New York City.

You’ll be instrumental in figuring out what types of technical account management actually help, why, and how to scale it. This is an incredibly fast-growing market. As the SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud thrives and expands in the coming years, you’ll have contributed significantly to that growth.\n\n### Why is this position unique?\n\nBig company benefits and customer base, startup flexibility. As Product Advocate, you’ll:\n\n- be the primary contact for your customers, not just a sales engineer. If you’re equally adept at cloning a git repo as you are at explaining why a product is valuable enough to pay for, this role is for you.\nhave an unusual amount of control over which actions may be worth your time. We’ll be brainstorming, selecting, and testing these together.\n- see the impact of your work every day – not in 0.1% of customers, but in 10% or 30% of customers. If something is demonstrably effective, you’ll help implement or share it widely.\n- sell products that you’d actually use yourself. Life is too short to represent a product you don’t care about.\n- sell products which already have thousands of satisfied customers.\n- interact with customers using newer technologies like Docker, Go, React, and Kubernetes as well as established products like PostgreSQL, nginx, and Heroku.\n\n### Qualifications\n\n- Technical expertise, so you can be useful to software developers and systems engineers. Perhaps you’ve been a sales engineer, customer success engineer, technical account manager or thrived in a “dev bootcamp” program. Maybe you’re writing code now and want a change.\n- Able to confidently explain that something costs money (and why!), and ideally, past experience in a sales role. If you have a demonstrated interest in business (like sales, entrepreneurship, or finance), even as a hobby, we want to hear.\n- You’re great at explaining complex ideas in writing. This position is 80% email or text, 20% interactive (voice or video)\n- Able to confidently give a screenshare-style product demo that attendees enjoy\n- You value the chance to help define the process. In past roles, maybe you’ve had strong opinions about how sales could do a better job or how you could do a better job if you were the sales rep.\n- Nice to have: Experience interacting with engineers on a daily basis (such as by selling a product to engineers or supporting a product used by engineers), and/or working with a distributed team (such as in Slack)\n\n### Examples of technical expertise\n\nPart of this job is identifying customer-specific use cases and opportunities where these products can be more helpful and thus get used more. These are usually technical conversations. To add value, you’ve probably done at least 1 of these 5 tasks or something very similar:\n\n- modified a Ruby, Python, Unix shell, or other script/code to do what you want or run correctly (or, of course, written your own)\n- cloned a git repo and committed a change\n- used a somewhat advanced command-line tool like tcpdump, strace, ntop, iptables, or awk\n- booted a Docker container or EC2/Xen instance\n- configured a daemon like rsyslog or sshd\n\n### Want to stand out?\n\nSign up for a SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud product (like Librato, Papertrail, or Pingdom), then write an email or record a screencast demo for an imaginary customer. In the email or screencast, explain why this product is a better fit than competitors.","publish_date":"2017-06-16"}]
