It’s Jacob at AgileBits, makers of [1Password](https://1password.com/company). Let’s get acquainted.\n\nAt some point in their life, everyone forgets one of their passwords. It’s an inevitable event. When they do, they usually change it to be more memorable, which means it’ll be easier to guess or crack. Our goal with 1Password is to make remembering and managing passwords a thing of the past. We built 1Password to make security accessible and easy, not distant and arduous.\n\nIt’s a noble pursuit, remembering passwords for people. With everything the app does, it can always do better. Every day, we speak with hundreds of our customers about their experience with 1Password, and we use that to improve it for everyone. We’re a team of just over 70 right now, and we’re looking to add even more wonderful ‘bits.\n\nFor all of us here at AgileBits, building and supporting 1Password is a dream job. Doing new things is the core of our culture, and we embrace it each day. Everyone in the company does customer support once a week, and we all brainstorm ways to make our customers’ experience better. Once a month, we have an all-hands call for the whole company to rally on the same page. We even go on an annual cruise to ponder the next 12 months of the journey, and to get to know each other in person. \uD83D\uDC4B\n\nAs a Herald of Support, you could be the first voice of AgileBits someone has heard, or you could be the bridge between them and the development team. You could find yourself helping with a sign-in issue in the morning and updating our troubleshooting article for it in the afternoon. We are, after all, quite an [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) bunch, and we get excited about _doing_.\n\n## What you might do\n\n- Help new and existing users have a great experience using 1Password.\n- Send well-written responses to customers, around 60 a day when you're up to speed.\n- Document new features and common questions in our knowledge base.\n- Be the voice of our customers internally: see that the top issues and requests each week are heard by the development team.\n- Learn how we do support as a remote company, and make it even better with your voice.\n- Try new things: we're agile, so new tools and ideas float around every few weeks.\n\n## What you have\n\n- Passion to help, love, and understand people, even the tough ones.\n- A knack for finding the cause of an issue, and the audacity to keep trying if you're wrong.\n- Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you're saying.\n- A personality that makes people smile and is delighted when they do.\n- Humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.\n- Optimism and positive written tone, even when it's raining and you forgot your umbrella (free shower!).\n\n## What you might also have\n\n- Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.\n- Personal experience with 1Password.\n- A peculiar desire to inspect things, particular elements of the web, often built of chrome or found in a safari; occasionally beside a fiery fox within an opera.\n- Building upon the previous point, you may even enjoy a cup of java while writing your script for the next production.\nIf you're a match\n\nSounding like a good fit? Let's start a conversation and see where it goes.","publish_date":"2017-02-07"},{"has_chat":"true","feature":"true","link":"jobs/illuminate-education.html","location":"Irvine, CA (Pacific Time) and Remote (Eastern Time)","published":"Feb 2","id":2,"title":"Illuminate Education Support Specialist","body":"\nWe're looking for a few friendly Support Specialists to join our team.

Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) and a Technical Support Engineer has contact with more customers than anyone else in the company.\n\nWhile support tickets may take most of your day, you’ll also work on internal and external documentation and have regular touch points with our Product and Customer Success teams to discuss feature requests, usability issues and user scenarios. You’ll bring your passion for customers and their problems to advocate for product improvements and provide insight that will help us make sure we build the right thing.\n\nTechnical Support Engineers develop deep product, systems and customer knowledge.

It's not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we're planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it may be a nice bonus.\n\n<b>Big impact:</b> Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company, both with our product and our culture.\n\n<b>Great tools:</b> Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you'd like to get your job done.\n\n<b>Health benefits:</b> We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental and vision.\n\n<b>Retreats:</b> We want everyone in our company to connect in person whenever possible, so we get everyone together once a year.
