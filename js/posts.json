We’re looking forward to getting to know you better, but you probably want to know what you’re getting yourself into. You can check out our careers page, or read on.\n\nAt Customer.io, our mission is helping businesses talk like people. Today, we do this with messaging software that allows businesses with large user-bases to send targeted, more relevant communication at scale. Our customers include Shutterstock, DigitalOcean, Handy, and Watsi.\n\n### A day in the life of a Technical Support Engineer\nA Technical Support Engineer at Customer.io helps new and existing customers get up and running in our product, diagnose tricky situations in the product, and achieve their business goals. Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) and a Technical Support Engineer has contact with more customers than anyone else in the company.\n\nWhile support tickets may take most of your day, you’ll also work on internal and external documentation and have regular touch points with our Product and Customer Success teams to discuss feature requests, usability issues and user scenarios. You’ll bring your passion for customers and their problems to advocate for product improvements and provide insight that will help us make sure we build the right thing.\n\nTechnical Support Engineers develop deep product, systems and customer knowledge. In the long run there are opportunities to apply that to automate processes and create internal tools or to join our Customer Success team which helps our high revenue customers make the most of our product. We have many new features to build and ideas to implement, so there will be plenty of exciting challenges ahead.\n\nToday the Technical Support team is powered by Help Scout for tickets, Github Issues for bug tracking and Zapier to help automate some of our support processes.\n\nAlthough, we mostly interact with each other through Basecamp and Slack and value focused work, we’re not afraid to jump on a Screenhero pairing session or a video call to clarify customer scenarios or share tips on how to troubleshoot issues better.\n\n### We’re the right match for you if:\n- You love technical problem solving\n- You enjoy helping others with your technical knowledge and take pride in your work.\n- You see every support ticket as an opportunity to improve the customer experience.\n- You take ownership of delivering results and get satisfaction from getting things done.\n- You’re passionate about learning new things.\n- You’re not afraid to ask questions if you’re confused about how something works.\n- You understand written communication is not always perfect and assume the best intentions during interactions with customers and your team. Empathy is one of your strongest attributes.\n\n### What we look for:\n- At least 2 years customer support experience.\n- Experience working remotely (it’s not your first time holding a full-time or part-time remote job).\n- HTML & CSS knowledge (just enough to troubleshoot and fix issues reported by customers).\n- Understanding of basic programming concepts (API, variables, if-else statements, loops, etc.). If you know some Javascript too even better!\n- Experience working with or supporting email marketing/ business communication tools preferred.\n- Located in the United States/ Canada or willing to work US Eastern or Pacific hours.\n\n### Why should you work with Customer.io?\n\nWe want to enable you to do your best work, and this is how we aim to do that—\n\n<b>Salary:</b> We are offering salary of $70,000 USD for this position.\n\n<b>Equity:</b> You’ll own a piece of the company. It's not a get-rich-quick deal, but if you stay around for a while, we're planning to be a long-lasting company, and your piece of it may be a nice bonus.\n\n<b>Big impact:</b> Our team is small, but growing quickly. The work you do will materially impact how successful we are as a company, both with our product and our culture.\n\n<b>Great tools:</b> Everyone in the company has a budget for a great computer, motorized standing desk, Steelcase Leap office chair, external monitor, and anything else you'd like to get your job done.\n\n<b>Health benefits:</b> We pay 100% of your premiums for medical, dental and vision.\n\n<b>Retreats:</b> We want everyone in our company to connect in person whenever possible, so we get everyone together once a year. We've had retreats in Barcelona, Romania, and Hunter Mountain, NY.\n\n<b>Vacation:</b> Rest and recuperation are important. We offer unlimited paid time off with a two week minimum per year.\n\n\n### Diversity at Customer.io\nAt Customer.io, we’re committed to building a diverse environment, and encourage minority applicants. So far, we have team members in Scotland, Germany, Canada, and all over the US. Our CEO and CTO grew up in Singapore and Arkansas respectively, but met in New York City. Our company culture is always evolving; people from different backgrounds bring valued perspective and thoughtfulness to the work that we do and the culture we foster.\n\nCustomer.io provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics. In addition to federal law requirements, Customer.io complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities.
