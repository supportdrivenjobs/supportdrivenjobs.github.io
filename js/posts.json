Not only that -- we’ve been increasing in size, training more people, adding more trainings, and getting bigger and stronger every year since.\n\nWe are a collaborative, growing team that creates and supports the world’s best training. Our online health and safety courses help save lives every day (literally -- we have heard countless stories from our customers who have saved the lives of loved ones after using our training).\n\nWe work out of an awesome, open building in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n### What we believe\nProviding life-saving training is a noble pursuit that is worth getting up every morning to create.\n\nWe believe that every team member is crucial and makes a difference, which is why we hire highly-motivated, hard-working, well-rounded people who pursue excellence in everything they do. That’s also why we’re very selective and particular about hiring great people, especially in this position, as you will be the face of our company to many of our customers.\n\nWe think that surprising and delighting our customers at every turn makes life-long, loyal supporters who rave about you to their friends; not to mention, it helps make the world a better place to live!\n\nWe believe that training should be FREE, because nobody should have to take out their wallet to learn how to save a life. In fact, we believe this so strongly, we created a StudentCPR program that trains thousands of high school students every single year.\n\nWe believe that you can work really hard and still have a ton of fun. You can play ping pong to blow off steam, chat with customers from our ceiling suspended hammock chair, and play games with co-workers at the office at night. Work and fun are not mutually exclusive -- having a good work-life balance is critical to loving your job and doing great work.\n\nWe love innovation. We don’t like to do things like everyone else. A great example is our Single Use Manikin Option (SUMO).
