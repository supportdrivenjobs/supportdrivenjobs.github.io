[{"link":"jobs/solarwinds-cloud.html","location":"Austin, TX","published":"Jun 16","id":1,"title":"SolarWinds Cloud (Librato, Papertrail, & Pingdom) Product Advocate / Technical Account Manager","body":"\nAs a Product Advocate, you’ll use technical experience, product knowledge, and sales skills to help every customer get the most value from SolarWinds’ Monitoring Cloud (SaaS) products:\n\n- Librato (infrastructure monitoring): https://www.librato.com/\n- Papertrail (log-centric troubleshooting): https://papertrailapp.com/\n- Pingdom (Web performance): https://www.pingdom.com/\n- TraceView (application performance monitoring) : https://traceview.solarwinds.com/\n\nIf you’ve made a restaurant reservation, collaborated in a text chat room, or purchased a plane ticket, you probably used a service which depends on SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud.\n\n### Why is this role important?\n\nYour customers, many of whom are fellow engineers, will come to see you as a trusted peer. You’ll be instrumental in figuring out what types of technical account management actually help, why, and how to scale it. This is an incredibly fast-growing market. As the SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud thrives and expands in the coming years, you’ll have contributed significantly to that growth.\n\n### Why is this position unique?\n\nBig company benefits and customer base, startup flexibility. As Product Advocate, you’ll:\n\n- be the primary contact for your customers, not just a sales engineer. If you’re equally adept at cloning a git repo as you are at explaining why a product is valuable enough to pay for, this role is for you.\nhave an unusual amount of control over which actions may be worth your time. We’ll be brainstorming, selecting, and testing these together.\n- see the impact of your work every day – not in 0.1% of customers, but in 10% or 30% of customers. If something is demonstrably effective, you’ll help implement or share it widely.\n- sell products that you’d actually use yourself. Life is too short to represent a product you don’t care about.\n- sell products which already have thousands of satisfied customers.\n- interact with customers using newer technologies like Docker, Go, React, and Kubernetes as well as established products like PostgreSQL, nginx, and Heroku.\n\n### Qualifications\n\n- Technical expertise, so you can be useful to software developers and systems engineers. Perhaps you’ve been a sales engineer, customer success engineer, technical account manager or thrived in a “dev bootcamp” program. Maybe you’re writing code now and want a change.\n- Able to confidently explain that something costs money (and why!), and ideally, past experience in a sales role. If you have a demonstrated interest in business (like sales, entrepreneurship, or finance), even as a hobby, we want to hear.\n- You’re great at explaining complex ideas in writing. This position is 80% email or text, 20% interactive (voice or video)\n- Able to confidently give a screenshare-style product demo that attendees enjoy\n- You value the chance to help define the process. In past roles, maybe you’ve had strong opinions about how sales could do a better job or how you could do a better job if you were the sales rep.\n- Nice to have: Experience interacting with engineers on a daily basis (such as by selling a product to engineers or supporting a product used by engineers), and/or working with a distributed team (such as in Slack)\n\n### Examples of technical expertise\n\nPart of this job is identifying customer-specific use cases and opportunities where these products can be more helpful and thus get used more. These are usually technical conversations. To add value, you’ve probably done at least 1 of these 5 tasks or something very similar:\n\n- modified a Ruby, Python, Unix shell, or other script/code to do what you want or run correctly (or, of course, written your own)\n- cloned a git repo and committed a change\n- used a somewhat advanced command-line tool like tcpdump, strace, ntop, iptables, or awk\n- booted a Docker container or EC2/Xen instance\n- configured a daemon like rsyslog or sshd\n\n### Want to stand out?\n\nSign up for a SolarWinds Monitoring Cloud product (like Librato, Papertrail, or Pingdom), then write an email or record a screencast demo for an imaginary customer. In the email or screencast, explain why this product is a better fit than competitors.","publish_date":"2017-06-16"},{"link":"jobs/sd-sponsorship-manager.html","location":"Remote","published":"Jun 14","id":2,"title":"Support Driven Sponsorship Manager","body":"\nSupport Driven is looking for a Sponsorship Manager. This is a project based opportunity to work on the next SUPCONF which will be November 6-7 in Atlanta. \n\nAs the Sponsorship Manager, your main responsibility is to manage sponsor activities from start to finish - including scheduling each step and ensuring everyone involved has what they need to stay on track and in communication.\n\nTo give you an idea of some things we've done in the past, here are a few examples:\n- Record attendee interviews at the event.\n- Online swag giveaways that tied in with a Kickstarter campaign.\n- Video game challenge to win a prize.\n- GIF Battle - 8 participants, lots of silliness, 1 winner.  \n\n## What's great about this role:\n- **SUPCONF attendees are appreciative and supportive.** We even have a channel in the Support Driven Slack to share ideas and get feedback on sponsorship activities.\n- **We focus on the attendee experience.** We ask all of our sponsors to contribute to making the event better for all attendees - we call it [potluck sponsorship](https://supportdriven.com/2016/08/15/potluck-sponsorship/).\n- **No sales.** You'll work with sponsors after they've signed up and paid.\n- **Build your network.** Working with people is a fantastic way to build relationships and you'll get to work with people from a lot of different companies. \n- **Travel included.** Of course you should be at the event that you helped put together.\n- **You can do this as a side project.** You don't have to quit your job for this. \n\n## What's hard about this role:\n- **Balancing expectations.** Sometimes what sponsors want can conflict with what we think is best for attendees or with what other sponsors are doing. It may not be possible for everyone to be happy at all times.\n- **Sponsors have other responsibilities too.** Sponsors want to be successful at our events and it's on us to work with them to help make that happen.\n- **Knowing where everyone is with everything and keeping everyone in the loop.** We've had 10+ sponsors for every event and that's a lot of things to keep track of. \n- **Things always go wrong.** We're always trying new ideas and new ideas always bring new challenges and new ways for things to go wrong. \n\n## Requirements\n- **Flexible schedule:** You will need to have availability from time to time during the work day to communicate with sponsors. It generally takes about 3-5 hours per week leading up to the event. About 4 weeks out it can go up to 10 hours or more a week as sponsors focus on the event. \n- **Attention to detail:** Making sure the details are right (or accounted for) are essential to being successful in this role.\n- **Organization:** Staying organized is key to keeping your sanity between all the different sponsors and all the different things they're doing.\n- **Adaptability:** Things will go wrong, hopefully in small ways and not blazing forest fire ways. You'll need to keep a cool head and deal with them effectively.\n\n## How to apply:\nSend an email to <a href=\"mailto:scott@supportdriven.com\">scott@supportdriven.com</a> with answers to the following questions:\n1. Describe a time when things went terribly wrong and how you handled it.\n2. How could this role help you take a step toward what you want to do next?\n3. Are you in the Support Driven Slack?

Dave.com outsmarts overdrafts by predicting your future expenses and unlocking your upcoming paycheck. Instead of charging interest or predatory fees, Dave lets users decide what is fair to pay in an effort to disrupt the $38bn in overdraft fees banks collected in 2016 alone.\n\nThat’s right. 0% interest. All we ask is that you tip us if we helped you. It was a crazy social experiment based on the belief that people are inherently good. We are happy to report that this is the case.\n\nThat said, compassion for others is key to our company culture and hopefully a value you cherish. Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.\n\nYour role is crucial as it informs everything we do - from marketing to product development. You are our eyes and ears on the ground. You'll not only help with customer support but you'll also take an active lead in crafting our voice on social media. By talking directly with customers, you'll develop insight as to exactly who our target audience is and how best to communicate with them to help serve their needs. One hand feeds the other.\n\nWe are started by a 4X entrepreneur ($85mm exit) and are backed by investors like Mark Cuban, SV Angel, The Chernin Group, David Friedberg, The Kraft Group, SRI, Diplo and more.

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip.\n\n### About The Job\nAs a Success Coach, you’ll support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. You’re on the front lines to interact with our customers via email and chat predominantly, but we also sprinkle in phone calls and the occasional in-person visit.\n\n### About You\nJoining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging work environment. You thrive as an individual contributor and you know how to get shit done. Still wondering whether this is the right role for you? The most successful candidates can:\n\n- Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things change all the time, especially with the product.\n- Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go.\n- Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company everyday, even if that value is created in a repetitive and not so glamorous way. #oneteamonedream\n- Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly.\n- Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about a bug or product flow that’s confusing for our customers, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem.\n- Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!\n\n### Next Steps\nLike what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:\n\n- Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?\n- Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?\n- If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?\n- What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?\n- How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.\n\nResume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways!

(That means actually solving problems for our users - not just saying what we think they want to hear.)\n\nThe next addition to our team will be someone who is legitimately passionate about providing the best in customer support - someone who can tackle tasks like hopping on an impromptu video call with a customer, or working on personalized onboarding and engagement campaigns alongside the rest of our solution-focused team members.\n\nEdgar launched in Summer 2014, and we already have thousands of happy, paying, fabulous customers.
