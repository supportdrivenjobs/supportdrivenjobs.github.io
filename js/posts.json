Our search is for coworkers who are great at cheerfully helping customers with our macOS and iOS products on the phone, as well as via email, Twitter, and on our forums. Support Humans work together as a team and with customers to answer questions, solve problems, and (whenever possible) have surprisingly pleasant conversations about software.\n\nWe look for hires with positivity, great phone skills, and who are good at thinking through problems on a computer they can’t actually see. We don’t rely on binders of troubleshooting scripts; your imagination will be one of your most important tools.\n\n### Job Activities\nWhen customers call with questions about our Mac & iOS apps, you’re their first contact. Know the answer? Great! If not, gather information and we’ll help you find it. (You should enjoy learning about technology; even if you know a lot, you’re going to learn more here.)\n\nWhen it comes to inventing great software, we believe being friendly is at least as important as being smart. If you need help with a problem, you’ll have plenty of people to ask - and they’ll be happy to talk about it. When we disagree, we do it respectfully. No one furthers themselves by tearing you down.\n\n### Compensation and Benefits\nOur amazing customers love our apps and push them to their limits. If earning gratitude by helping them brings you happiness, you’ll enjoy this job. We depend on Support Humans when crafting our products; they speak for and represent our customers’ needs.\n\nWe offer a base salary in the mid-$40k/year range, a 401k with matching, incredible insurance for you and your family, and the potential for profit sharing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We know our industry has a diversity problem; we’re trying to be part of the solution.\n\nWe also offer lots of other great benefits, which you can read about elsewhere on our website.

Every applicant that sends a resume before May 15th will receive a set of sample support questions to work on; applicants will have until May 22nd to submit responses. Those answers are by far the most important factor we’ll use when selecting applicants to invite in for interviews.","publish_date":"2017-05-04"},{"link":"jobs/skyverge.html","location":"Anywhere","published":"May 3","id":4,"title":"SkyVerge Customer Support Specialist","body":"\nHiya.

We’re looking for two Customer Support Specialists to join our fully-distributed team and help support our entire suite of products.\n\n### The Role\nYou’ll be the first point of contact for our customers, helping them with problems, and answering questions. As part of a small team, you'll likely get your hands dirty with a little bit of everything.\n\nHere are some things you may do on a given day:\n\n- Assist customers by troubleshooting technical problems and escalating to the engineering team as needed\n- Answer pre-sales questions, billing & account changes, and other feedback from customers\n- Monitor social media and forums where customers may have questions or issues with our products and get them the help they need\n- Help with customer onboarding by installing and modifying code on customers’ stores\n- Write technical documentation and other content so customer’s can help themselves\n- Help our engineering & product teams to identify areas where we can improve the customer experience\n- Document and optimize our support process to improve customer satisfaction\n\nWith over 70 products across the three eCommerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads) that we support, there's plenty to learn.

Following that, you’ll have a few 30 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.\n\nIf this goes well, we’ll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day Bootcamp. This is a trial period where you’ll work full-time as a contractor, or part-time on nights/weekends if you already have a full-time position. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. We’ll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure we’re on the same page. At the end of the 30 days, you’ll be offered a permanent position \uD83D\uDE42\n\n### Benefits\n\nHere are some benefits we're excited to offer to our team members:\n\n- Competitive salary\n- Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals\n- 25 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June \uD83D\uDE00)\n- Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)\n- 401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)\n- Work from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection\n- The tools (hardware/software) you need to be productive\n- Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)\n- Home office or co-working allowance\n- A Kindle to help you keep learning\n\nWe support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class.
