All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability or age.","publish_date":"2016-10-10"},{"link":"jobs/threadless.html","location":"Chicago, IL","published":"Oct 6","id":2,"title":"Threadless Community Experience: Help Team","body":"\nThreadless is build on a rock solid community.

But what about all those people out there who could use a little extra push? Well, That’s where you come in, dear reader - we’re looking for a User Outreach Specialist who can lead the charge on identifying and nurturing leads, leading product demos, and whatever else our pre-customers might need!\n\n### About You\nYou’re a take-charge sort of guy/gal/non-binary individual - somebody who can tell when a person needs a nudge or three in the right direction, and proactively gives them the information they need to make their own brilliant decisions. You’re not a salesperson - you’re a matchmaker, setting people up with bliss-inducing solutions to their most problem-y problems.\nIn this position, that means working with our marketing team to do things like:\n\n- Identify and nurture leads via email, social media, and more\n- Conduct personalized one-on-one demos as needed\n- Respond to emails and online chats from our leads\n- Transition new customers into our onboarding process\n\nSometimes, the people who’ll benefit most from your help and expertise will come to you - other times, you’ll seek them out yourself. That means you’re someone who understands the weird lil’ intersection of social media, SaaS products, and content marketing where Edgar lives, and the issues that are important to anyone else in that neighborhood. \n\nHow can you tell when what we offer is what someone’s looking for? How do you communicate that - and how does your strategy change from person to person? What matters most to one type of lead versus another, and how do you help them meet their needs? These are the types of questions you’ll be answering in this position - so be ready! (Sorry, we totally didn’t give you a spoiler alert beforehand.)\n\nBecause this role requires significant interaction with potential customers, you’ll work alongside both our Marketing and Customer Experience teams to make our relationships with our leads better than ever. From conducting proactive outreach to responding to the needs of prospective users, your day-to-day will be the types of one-on-one interactions that a people person’s dreams are made of!\n\n### Job Deets Cheat Sheet\n- This is a full-time, salaried remote position - you must live somewhere in North America and be able to show eligibility to work in the USA\n- Sales/marketing experience a plus\n- Customer service experience also preferred, ideally with technology-related products/services\n- An extrovert’s love of reaching out to new people (an introvert’s love of staying at home is okay, though)\n- Able to read a situation and determine someone’s needs - even if they don’t spell them out for you\n- Confident hosting live demos, Q&A sessions, and sing-a-longs\n- Demonstrably good judgment\n\n### About Us\nWe’re a small team of 18-ish people, all working remotely across the US & Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual retreat week where we work together on cool projects all day and rock the karaoke mic all night. (Spoiler alert: This means you have to be willing and able to travel to those retreats! The karaoke, however, is optional.) \nWe’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks. \n\nWe'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck.

We like those people.)\n\nYou can find out more at http://meetedgar.com/careers/ and by watching this video (please watch it, it was mad expensive):\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvU3P43b0rQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Perks & Benefits\n- Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)\n- 4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam!

You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered after interacting with support and not stupid because of a small mistake.</p>\n<p>You obsess over the details. Maybe you have a one emoticon and one exclamation point rule of thumb for every email. Maybe it's only two sentences per paragraph. Either way, you make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes the customer delighted to work with you.</p>\n<p>You love solving problems. Every customer is different, many times radically so. You relish being able to meet their specific need, and also solving their problems that may have gone unsaid.</p>\n<p>You love to write. Almost everything at Zapier is done via written communication (both with customers and between teammates).</p>\n<p>You're persistent. Support at Zapier is much different than at many software companies. It's not the same questions over and over again, and often involves researching technical nuances of the apps we support.

At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.</p>\n<p>You love to set your own course. At Zapier, we have quick team meetings each week and one-on-one meetings every month and then we go make things happen. You get to make things happen without someone saying so.</p>\n<h2>Things You Might Do</h2>\n<p>Zapier is a startup, so you'll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you'll get to lead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions.</li>\n<li>Write documentation to help users help themselves (all the documentation on our help site is written and maintained by the support team: https://zapier.com/help/)</li>\n<li>Work with the product team to build tools that will speed up and increase the quality of support at the same time</li>\n<li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About Zapier</h2>\n<p>For the past five years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.</p>\n<p>We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.</p>\n<p>We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.</p>\n<p>We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done. </p>\n<h2>The Whole Package</h2>\n<p>Location: Anywhere you want.</p>\n<p>If you want to work remote, that's cool.
