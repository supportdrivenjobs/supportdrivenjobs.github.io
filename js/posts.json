We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!\n\n### About The Job\nAs a Success Coach, you will be focused on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify to solve the problems they face. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems with which we integrate. You’ll also gather feedback on how we can evolve Expensify to meet our customer’s needs in the future, and apply your product knowledge to map out these improvements for engineering. When product changes happen, you’ll lead the charge via documentation, blog posts, emails, calls and in-person visits with our customers.\n\nJoining our team means you will be working in our fast-paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most-discussed perk is our offshore, where we spend a month abroad working as a team from a remote location. Last year we went to Cambodia and Thailand. Where do you want to go next?\n\n### About You\nYou’re an entrepreneur who enjoys thinking through challenging problems, working across functional groups and articulating yourself in both technical and non-technical settings. You’re poised and confident when talking to customers and can always find the time to work with your colleagues to get any issue resolved.\n\nFor the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:\n\n- Has excellent communication skills. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, the next moment need to communicate how we are going to sell this feature with a member of the sales team, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in all scenarios.\n- Is passionate about building, maintaining and making our software better. It’s what we do as a company.\n- Can manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.\n- Is comfortable learning from peers in an informal fashion. After all, we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.\n- Is well-versed in saying “no”. We often have to say no to ensure that our product stays simple and user-friendly. Saying no and having a compelling argument as to why requires in-depth product knowledge and knowledge of the problem that the customer is trying to solve and is critical to success in this role.\n\n### Next Steps\nLike what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:\n\n1. Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?\n\n2. If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?\n\n3. Describe a scenario where you interacted with an irate person. How were you able to turn them around (assuming you were able to)?\n\n4. What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?\n\n5. How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend?

We work with tens of thousands of ops-savvy developers, systems engineers, and entrepreneurs at companies like GitHub, Heroku, Instacart, Adobe, and DNSimple.\n\nThat's where you come in. We've grown to need technical customer support to help customers make the most of Papertrail. Here's a few examples of what customers think of Papertrail's support:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TiuTalk/status/714592766827872257\nhttps://twitter.com/agmakonts/status/730356796607614976\nhttps://twitter.com/hectcastro/status/717523363032391680\n\n## Summary\n\n* Put smiles on the faces of fellow engineers\n* Remote work is welcome\n* 100% online (email, Slack/Campfire text chat), no phones\n* Startup atmosphere and tools, public company benefits\n\n\n## Okay, cool. What's involved?\n\nHelp customers setup and use Papertrail's service in email and text chat. The questions are about a wide range of topics like Linux, syslog, Web framework logging, Ruby, Rails, IP stack troubleshooting, PHP, REST/JSON, Python, firewall rules, Node.js, plus non-technical topics.\n\nYou almost certainly won't know about all of these. While a strong working knowledge of Linux is required, Googling to satisfy your own curiosity is a lot more valuable (and hopefully, fun). Also:\n\n* Be comfortable and personable in email, even when interacting with strangers.\n* Show a passion for devops tools, Web services, and technology in general. We're doing this because we love it.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **Working Linux knowledge**. You've compiled a binary, installed packages, and understand TCP/IP concepts. Experience with tools like `tcpdump` or `strace` will help, though it isn't required.\n* **Fantastic casual writing skills**. This job involves helping people in email, forums, and text chat, so a written voice goes a long way. Good grammar is critical, as is a gut feel for when to ignore it in order to make a personal connection. When a friend emails you a question, do you spend 10 minutes Googling and send them a ridiculously thoughtful answer? You'll fit right in. A public online history (like a blog, Stack Overflow/Server Fault posts, GitHub commit history, Twitter account, or casual posts to non-technical online forums) is ideal, since a big part of this job is showing your passion and knowledge for a topic in casual, freeform emails.\n* **Scripting**. Experience in a scripting or programming language, ideally in one or more of Ruby, Python, Go, Java, or C.\n* **Location and timezone**. Able to work in US, Canada, or Europe on a roughly UTC-7 workday. Although we're completely location-agnostic, employment law is not.\n\n\n## Why is this unusually awesome?\n\nIt's the most important thing we do. Happy customers are the only reason why we get to do this every day. Since most of our interactions with customers are via support, this is the most important thing we do every day and the main reason we grow. It's:\n\n* **Flexible.** Papertrail's hub is a Slack text chat channel. Work in a coffee shop without missing office conversation.\n* **Personal**. You'll be part of a tiny team, working side by side with the founders. Debating product decisions is a lot more fun because we're all target users – 100% of Papertrail staff has sent a GitHub pull request.\n* **The tip of the iceberg**. Although answering questions is the must-have, you're welcome to write docs, improve our open-source apps, or grow into coding on the core service. We operate in 3 thriving fields: cloud computing, software as a service, and dev/ops, and the tools we use are in demand: Ruby, Java/Scala, and current open-source libraries.\n* **Predictable**.
