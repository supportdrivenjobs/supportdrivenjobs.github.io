This is a project based opportunity to work on the next SUPCONF. \n\nAs the Sponsorship Manager, your main responsibility is to manage sponsor activities from start to finish - including scheduling each step and ensuring everyone involved has what they need to stay on track and in communication.\n\n## What's great about this role:\n- **SUPCONF attendees are appreciative and supportive.** We even have a channel in the Support Driven Slack to share ideas and get feedback on sponsorship activities.\n- **We focus on the attendee experience.** We ask all of our sponsors to contribute to making the event better for all attendees - we call it [potluck sponsorship](https://supportdriven.com/2016/08/15/potluck-sponsorship/).\n- **No sales.** You'll work with sponsors after they've signed up and paid.\n- **Build your network.** Working with people is a fantastic way to build relationships and you'll get to work with people from a lot of different companies. \n- **Travel included.** Of course you should be at the event that you helped put together.\n- **You can do this as a side project.** You don't have to quit your job for this. \n\n## What's hard about this role:\n- **Balancing expectations.** Sometimes what sponsors want can conflict with what we think is best for attendees or with what other sponsors are doing. It may not be possible for everyone to be happy at all times.\n- **Sponsors have other responsibilities too.** Sponsors want to be successful at our events and it's on us to work with them to help make that happen.\n- **Knowing where everyone is with everything and keeping everyone in the loop.** We've had 10+ sponsors for every event and that's a lot of things to keep track of. \n- **Things always go wrong.** We're always trying new ideas and new ideas always bring new challenges and new ways for things to go wrong. \n\n## Requirements\n- **Flexible schedule:** You will need to have availability from time to time during the work day to communicate with sponsors. It generally takes about 3-5 hours per week leading up to the event. About 4 weeks out it can go up to 10 hours or more a week as sponsors focus on the event. \n- **Attention to detail:** Making sure the details are right (or accounted for) are essential to being successful in this role.\n- **Organization:** Staying organized is key to keeping your sanity between all the different sponsors and all the different things they're doing.\n- **Adaptability:** Things will go wrong, hopefully in small ways and not blazing forest fire ways. You'll need to keep a cool head and deal with them effectively.\n\n# Past Activities\n- Record attendee interviews at the event.\n- Online swag giveaways that tied in with a Kickstarter campaign.\n- Video game challenge to win a prize.\n- GIF Battle - 8 participants, lots of silliness, 1 winner.  \n\n## How to apply:\nSend an email to <a href=\"mailto:scott@supportdriven.com\">scott@supportdriven.com</a> with answers to the following questions:\n1. Describe a time when things went terribly wrong and how you handled it.\n2. How could this role help you take a step toward what you want to do next?\n3. Are you in the Support Driven Slack?

Dave.com outsmarts overdrafts by predicting your future expenses and unlocking your upcoming paycheck. Instead of charging interest or predatory fees, Dave lets users decide what is fair to pay in an effort to disrupt the $38bn in overdraft fees banks collected in 2016 alone.\n\nThat’s right. 0% interest. All we ask is that you tip us if we helped you. It was a crazy social experiment based on the belief that people are inherently good. We are happy to report that this is the case.\n\nThat said, compassion for others is key to our company culture and hopefully a value you cherish. Our customers often come to us at some of the most desperate moments of their life, so the products we develop have real-world and immediate consequences. The more you can understand and have compassion for our customers, the better your solutions to their problems will be.\n\nYour role is crucial as it informs everything we do - from marketing to product development. You are our eyes and ears on the ground. You'll not only help with customer support but you'll also take an active lead in crafting our voice on social media. By talking directly with customers, you'll develop insight as to exactly who our target audience is and how best to communicate with them to help serve their needs. One hand feeds the other.\n\nWe are started by a 4X entrepreneur ($85mm exit) and are backed by investors like Mark Cuban, SV Angel, The Chernin Group, David Friedberg, The Kraft Group, SRI, Diplo and more. We have great healthcare, cute office dogs, a patio to get your daily intake of Vitamin D and a basketball hoop to get you from slouching. But more important than all this stuff, we’re sick of people getting ripped off by banks and predatory lenders. We’re not a budgeting app. That’s for rich people. We’re here to help the majority of Americans living between the coasts.

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip.\n\n### About The Job\nAs a Success Coach, you’ll support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. You’re on the front lines to interact with our customers via email and chat predominantly, but we also sprinkle in phone calls and the occasional in-person visit.\n\n### About You\nJoining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and challenging work environment. You thrive as an individual contributor and you know how to get shit done. Still wondering whether this is the right role for you? The most successful candidates can:\n\n- Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things change all the time, especially with the product.\n- Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go.\n- Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company everyday, even if that value is created in a repetitive and not so glamorous way. #oneteamonedream\n- Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly.\n- Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about a bug or product flow that’s confusing for our customers, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem.\n- Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!\n\n### Next Steps\nLike what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:\n\n- Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?\n- Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?\n- If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?\n- What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?\n- How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.\n\nResume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href=\"mailto:jobs@expensify.com\">jobs@expensify.com</a>.

Our product serves an amazing community of business owners, bloggers, and social media professionals, and you’ll be on the front lines for answering their questions and keeping them happy as heck.\n\nOur CX team operates on a solution-driven philosophy, and we want to up the ante with even more personalized, one-on-one attention wherever we can. (That means actually solving problems for our users - not just saying what we think they want to hear.)\n\nThe next addition to our team will be someone who is legitimately passionate about providing the best in customer support - someone who can tackle tasks like hopping on an impromptu video call with a customer, or working on personalized onboarding and engagement campaigns alongside the rest of our solution-focused team members.\n\nEdgar launched in Summer 2014, and we already have thousands of happy, paying, fabulous customers. We’re also growing by about ~20% month over month, which means lots of users - and lots of support!

(Or juggling chainsaws, because that’d be SO COOL.) You don’t take it personally when someone has a complaint, so when the going gets salty, you stay sweet and bounce right back to help out whoever’s next in line. We live on the Internet, so you’re a master of written communication and can always tell whether someone needs a quick answer or a little extra hand-holding. You love working with tech, exploring new tools and apps, and using your black belt in Google Fu to find resourceful solutions for the most problem-y problems.\n\nWe’re into CS that’s smart, proactive, and actually helpful, so don’t expect to spend day after day getting smacked in the face with complaints and sending the same soul-sucking form responses to people.

You’ve got a mind of your own, and you’re looking for a job that’ll let you use it, and make serious contributions outside of just answering emails. (Even though you’re a total pro at it.)\n\nYou're not just a job-doer - you're a job-FINISHER. One who takes ownership of the challenges you face, and sees them through to the end!\n\nAnd you know, you’re a just-plain-swell human being. (It’s okay for you to admit that!) Customer service takes smarts AND a sparkling personality, and yours sparkles like a diamond fresh out of the dishwasher. You love being part of an awesome team, but you’re also good at the whole self-management thing - you’re in charge of a lot of your own workflow, so you’ve gotta be able to focus and prioritize without anyone creepily staring at you over the wall of a cubicle.\n\n### You should . . .\n- Have previous SaaS support, help desk, or call center experience.
